    abstract = "Climate change mediated drying of boreal peatlands is expected to enhance peatland afforestation and wildfire vulnerability. The water table depth{--}afforestation feedback represents a positive feedback that can enhance peat drying and consolidation and thereby increase peat burn severity; exacerbating the challenges and costs of wildfire suppression efforts and potentially shifting the peatland to a persistent source of atmospheric carbon. To address this wildfire management challenge, we examined burn severity across a gradient of drying in a black spruce dominated peatland that was partially drained in 1975−1980 and burned in the 2016 Fort McMurray Horse River wildfire. We found that post-drainage black spruce annual ring width increased substantially with intense drainage. Average ({\mbox{$\pm$}}SD) basal diameter was 2.6 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 1.2 cm, 3.2 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 2.0 cm and 7.9 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 4.7 cm in undrained (UD), moderately drained (MD) and heavily drained (HD) treatments, respectively. Depth of burn was significantly different between treatments (p {\textless} 0.001) and averaged ({\mbox{$\pm$}}SD) 2.5 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 3.5 cm, 6.4 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 5.0 cm and 36.9 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 29.6 cm for the UD, MD and HD treatments, respectively. The high burn severity in the HD treatment included 38{\%} of the treatment that experienced combustion of the entire peat profile, and we estimate that overall 51{\%} of the HD pre-burn peat carbon stock was lost. We argue that the HD treatment surpassed an ecohydrological tipping point to high severity peat burn that may be identified using black spruce stand characteristics in boreal plains bogs. While further studies are needed, we believe that quantifying this threshold will aid in developing effective adaptive management techniques and protecting boreal peatland carbon stocks.",
