    abstract = "Ephemeral ponds in depressions are the foci of groundwater recharge in the Canadian Prairies. Freeze{--}thaw processes influence snowmelt runoff and depression‐focused recharge. A new water balance model was developed to represent these processes. The water balance model successfully simulated the observed soil processes. This model will provide a tool to estimate recharge in the prairie landscape.",
