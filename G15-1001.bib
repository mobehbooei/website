    abstract = "daesa, Differential-Algebraic Equations Structural Analyzer, is a Matlab tool for structural analysis of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). It allows convenient translation of a DAE system into Matlab and provides a small set of easy-to-use functions. daesa can analyze systems that are fully nonlinear, high-index, and of any order. It determines structural index, number of degrees of freedom, constraints, variables to be initialized, and suggests a solution scheme. The structure of a DAE can be readily visualized by this tool. It also can construct a block-triangular form of the DAE, which can be exploited to solve it efficiently in a block-wise manner. This article describes the theory and algorithms underlying the code.",
