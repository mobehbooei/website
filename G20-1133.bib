    abstract = "Abstract. Despite debate in the rainfall{--}runoff hydrology literature about the meritsof physics-based and spatially distributed models, substantial work in cold-region hydrology has shown improved predictive capacity by includingphysics-based process representations, relatively high-resolution semi-distributed andfully distributed discretizations, and the use of physically identifiableparameters that require limited calibration. While there is increasingmotivation for modelling at hyper-resolution (  1 km) and snowdrift-resolving scales ( {\mbox{$\approx$}}  1 to 100 m), the capabilities ofexisting cold-region hydrological models are computationally limited atthese scales. Here, a new distributed model, the Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM), ispresented. Although designed to be applied generally, it has a focus forapplication where cold-region processes play a role in hydrology. Keyfeatures include the ability to do the following: capture spatial heterogeneity in the surfacediscretization in an efficient manner via variable-resolution unstructuredmeshes; include multiple process representations; change,remove, and decouple hydrological process algorithms; work at both apoint and spatially distributed scale; scale to multiple spatialextents and scales; and utilize a variety of forcing fields (boundary andinitial conditions). This paper focuses on the overall model philosophyand design, and it provides a number of cold-region-specific features andexamples.",
