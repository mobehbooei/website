    abstract = "Abstract. This paper describes ESM-SnowMIP, an international coordinated modellingeffort to evaluate current snow schemes, including snow schemes that areincluded in Earth system models, in a wide variety of settings against localand global observations. The project aims to identify crucial processes andcharacteristics that need to be improved in snow models in the context oflocal- and global-scale modelling. A further objective of ESM-SnowMIP is tobetter quantify snow-related feedbacks in the Earth system. Although it isnot part of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project(CMIP6), ESM-SnowMIP is tightly linked to the CMIP6-endorsed Land Surface,Snow and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison (LS3MIP).",
