    abstract = "Polyvalent metal ions are susceptible to hydrolysis, making their reproducible detection by sensors and biosensors difficult. We herein turned this disadvantage into an advantage to develop a high selectivity colorimetric method for detecting Ce(iv) by intentionally hydrolyzing it through heating, where subsequent addition of F- recovered the activity, allowing a detection limit of 3.8 Î¼M Ce(iv).",
