    abstract = "The absence of a rigorous mechanism for prioritizing investment in endangered species management is a major implementation hurdle affecting recovery. Here, we present a method for prioritizing strategies for endangered species management based on the likelihood of achieving species{'} recovery goals per dollar invested. We demonstrate our approach for 15 species listed under Canada's Species at Risk Act that co‐occur in Southwestern Saskatchewan. Without management, only two species have {\textgreater}50{\%} probability of meeting recovery objectives; whereas, with management, 13 species exceed the {\textgreater}50{\%} threshold with the implementation of just five complementary strategies at a cost of {\$}126m over 20 years. The likelihood of meeting recovery objectives rarely exceeded 70{\%} and two species failed to reach the {\textgreater}50{\%} threshold. Our findings underscore the need to consider the cost, benefit, and feasibility of management strategies when developing recovery plans in order to prioritize implementation in a timely and cost‐effective manner.",
