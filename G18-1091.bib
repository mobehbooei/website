    abstract = "Abstract. Decoupling the integrated microwave signal originating from soiland vegetation remains a challenge for all microwave remote sensingapplications. To improve satellite and airborne microwave data products inforest environments, a precise and reliable estimation of the relativepermittivity (ε=ε′-iε′′) of trees is required. Wedeveloped an open-ended coaxial probe suitable for in situpermittivity measurements of tree trunks at L-band frequencies (1{--}2 GHz).The probe is characterized by uncertainty ratios under 3.3 {\%} for a broadrange of relative permittivities (unitless), [2{--}40] forε′ and [0.1{--}20] for ε′′. We quantifiedthe complex number describing the permittivity of seven different treespecies in both frozen and thawed states: black spruce, larch, red spruce,balsam fir, red pine, aspen and black cherry. Permittivity variability issubstantial and can range up to 300 {\%} for certain species. Our resultsshow that the permittivity of wood is linked to the freeze{--}thaw state ofvegetation and that even short winter thaw events can lead to an increase invegetation permittivity. The open-ended coaxial probe proved to be preciseenough to capture the diurnal cycle of water storage inside the trunk for thelength of the growing season.",
