There is a wealth of information that supports that groundwater pumping has perturbed the hydrologic cycle at a global scale (Konikow 2011; Rodell et al. 2018) and perturbations to global elemental cycles would not be unexpected. However, the analysis presented by Stahl (2018) is problematic. Stahl assumes that the 45% of produced waters from oil field operations that were not used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) are released into the more active portion of the hydrological cycle based on 2007 figures for the United States from Clark and Veil (2009). This figure is substantially lower in reality. Clark and Veil (2009) report that 38.2% of produced waters were injected into nonproducing strata. This injection occurs almost exclusively through Class II disposal wells, which are typically installed in saline aquifers (EPA 2018). Similar practices have been noted in Canada, where there has been a net gain in the amount of water in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (Ferguson 2015). In addition, Stahl states that 45% of Shell’s produced water is discharged at the surface based on an estimate from Khatib and Verbeek (2003). However, that study also noted that much of this discharge was to the ocean as part of offshore drilling activities. The overestimation of addition of produced water to the active portion of global elemental cycles will have a notable effect on estimates of fluxes of elements such as Li, Na, Cl, and Ca, which are found in high concentrations</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.3.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Many of these brines are known to be connate waters that have persisted since the early Paleozoic Era. Yet questions remain about their distribution and mechanisms for retention at depth in the Earth's crust. Here we demonstrate that there is insufficient topography to drive these dense fluids from the bottom of deep sedimentary basins. Our assessment based on driving force ratio indicates that sedimentary basins with driving force ratio > 1 contain connate waters and frequently host large evaporite deposits. These stagnant conditions appear to be relatively stable over geological time and insensitive to factors such as glaciations, erosion, compaction, and hydrocarbon generation.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.4.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Declining water tables and near-surface contamination are driving groundwater users to construct deeper wells in many US aquifer systems. This has been a successful short-term mitigation measure where deep groundwater is fresh and free of contaminants. Nevertheless, vertical salinity profiles are not well-constrained at continental-scales. In many regions, oil and gas activities use pore spaces for energy production and waste disposal. Here we quantify depths that aquifer systems transition from fresh-to-brackish and where oil and gas activities are widespread in sedimentary basins across the United States. Fresh-brackish transitions occur at relatively shallow depths of just a few hundred meters, particularly in eastern US basins. We conclude that fresh groundwater is less abundant in several key US basins than previously thought; therefore drilling deeper wells to access fresh groundwater resources is not feasible extensively across the continent. Our findings illustrate that groundwater stores are being depleted not only by excessive withdrawals, but due to injection, and potentially contamination, from the oil and gas industry in areas of deep fresh and brackish groundwater.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.5.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Groundwater storage in alpine watersheds was long considered negligible, but recent field‐based studies have shown that aquifers are ubiquitous in the alpine zone with no soil and vegetation. Talus, moraine, and rock glacier aquifers are common in many alpine regions of the world, although bedrock aquifers occur in some geological settings. Alpine aquifers consisting of coarse sediments have a fast recession of discharge after the recharge season (e.g., snowmelt) or rainfall events, followed by a slow recession that sustains discharge over a long period. The two‐phase recession is likely controlled by the internal structure of the aquifers. Spatial extent and distribution of individual aquifers determine the groundwater storage‐discharge characteristics in first‐ and second‐order watersheds in the alpine zone, which in turn govern baseflow characteristics in major rivers. Similar alpine landforms appear to have similar hydrogeological characteristics in many mountain ranges across the world, suggesting that a common conceptual framework can be used to understand alpine aquifers based on geological and geomorphological settings. Such a framework will be useful for parameterizing storage‐discharge characteristics in large river hydrological models.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.8.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Here, we integrate stable isotope (2H and 18O of soil water, precipitation, and groundwater) and hydrometric (soil moisture) data from 5 long‐term experimental catchments along a hydroclimatic gradient across northern latitudes: Dry Creek (USA), Bruntland Burn (Scotland), Dorset (Canada), Krycklan (Sweden), and Wolf Creek (Canada). Within each catchment, 6 to 11 isotope sampling campaigns occurred at 2 to 4 sampling locations over at least 1 year. Analysis for 2H and 18O in the bulk pore water was done for >2,500 soil samples either by cryogenic extraction (Dry Creek) or by direct equilibration (other sites). The results showed a similar general pattern that soil water isotope variability reflected the seasonality of the precipitation input signal. However, pronounced differences among sampling locations occurred regarding the isotopic fractionation due to evaporation. We found that antecedent precipitation volumes mainly governed the fractionation signal, temperature and evaporation rates were of secondary importance, and soil moisture played only a minor role in the variability of soil water evaporation fractionation across the hydroclimatic gradient. We further observed that soil waters beneath conifer trees were more fractionated than beneath heather shrubs or red oak trees, indicating higher soil evaporation rates in coniferous forests. Sampling locations closer to streams were more damped and depleted in their stable isotopic composition than hillslope sites, revealing increased subsurface mixing towards the saturated zone and a preferential recharge of winter precipitation. Bulk soil waters generally comprised a high share of waters older than 14 days, which indicates that the water in soil pores are usually not fully replaced by recent infiltration events. The presented stable isotope data of soil water were, thus, a useful tool to track the spatial variability of water fluxes within and from the critical zone. Such data provide invaluable information to improve the representation of critical zone processes in spatially distributed hydrological models.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.9.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

However, catchments underlain by permafrost have received little attention in isotope‐based studies, despite their global importance in terms of rapid environmental change. These high‐latitude regions offer limited access for data collection during critical periods (e.g., early phases of snowmelt). Additionally, spatio‐temporal variable freeze–thaw cycles, together with the development of an active layer, have a time variant influence on catchment hydrology. All of these characteristics make the application of traditional transit time estimation approaches challenging. We describe an isotope‐based study undertaken to provide a preliminary assessment of travel times at Siksik Creek in the western Canadian Arctic. We adopted a model–data fusion approach to estimate the volumes and isotopic characteristics of snowpack and meltwater. Using samples collected in the spring/summer, we characterize the isotopic composition of summer rainfall, melt from snow, soil water, and stream water. In addition, soil moisture dynamics and the temporal evolution of the active layer profile were monitored. First approximations of transit times were estimated for soil and streamwater compositions using lumped convolution integral models and temporally variable inputs including snowmelt, ice thaw, and summer rainfall. Comparing transit time estimates using a variety of inputs revealed that transit time was best estimated using all available inflows (i.e., snowmelt, soil ice thaw, and rainfall). Early spring transit times were short, dominated by snowmelt and soil ice thaw and limited catchment storage when soils are predominantly frozen. However, significant and increasing mixing with water in the active layer during the summer resulted in more damped steam water variation and longer mean travel times (~1.5 years). The study has also highlighted key data needs to better constrain travel time estimates in permafrost catchments.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.10.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

These observations can be used in real‐time applications like early flood warning systems and reservoir operations, provided they are made available to users with sufficient lead time. Yet the temporal requirements for access to satellite‐based river data remain uncharacterized for time‐sensitive applications. Here we present a global approximation of flow wave travel time to assess the utility of existing and future low‐latency/near‐real‐time satellite products, with an emphasis on the forthcoming SWOT satellite mission. We apply a kinematic wave model to a global hydrography data set and find that global flow waves traveling at their maximum speed take a median travel time of 6, 4, and 3 days to reach their basin terminus, the next downstream city, and the next downstream dam, respectively. Our findings suggest that a recently proposed ≤2‐day data latency for a low‐latency SWOT product is potentially useful for real‐time river applications.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.11.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Fires range from slow smouldering peat fires, to low-intensity surface fires, to intense crown fires, depending on vegetation structure, fuel moisture, prevailing climate, and weather conditions. While the links between biogeochemistry, climate and fire are widely studied within Earth system science, these relationships are also mediated by fuels—namely plants and their litter—that are the product of evolutionary and ecological processes. Fire is a powerful selective force and, over their evolutionary history, plants have evolved traits that both tolerate and promote fire numerous times and across diverse clades. Here we outline a conceptual framework of how plant traits determine the flammability of ecosystems and interact with climate and weather to influence fire regimes. We explore how these evolutionary and ecological processes scale to impact biogeochemical and Earth system processes. Finally, we outline several research challenges that, when resolved, will improve our understanding of the role of plant evolution in mediating the fire feedbacks driving Earth system processes. Understanding current patterns of fire and vegetation, as well as patterns of fire over geological time, requires research that incorporates evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, and the biogeosciences.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.12.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Land surface evaporation has considerable spatial variability thatis not captured by point-scale estimates calculated from meteorological dataalone. Knowing how evaporation varies spatially remains an important issuefor improving parameterisations of land surface schemes and hydrologicalmodels and various land management practices. Satellite-based and aerialremote sensing has been crucial for capturing moderate- to larger-scalesurface variables to indirectly estimate evaporative fluxes. However, morerecent advances for field research via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) now allowfor the acquisition of more highly detailed surface data. Integrating models that can estimate “actual” evaporation from higher-resolution imagery and surface reference data would be valuable to better examine potential impacts of local variations in evaporation on upscaled estimates. This study introduces a novel approach for computing a normalised ratiometric index from surface variables that can be used to obtain more-realistic distributed estimates of actual evaporation. For demonstration purposes the Granger–Gray evaporation model (Granger and Gray, 1989) was applied at a rolling prairie agricultural site in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Visible and thermal images and meteorological reference data required to parameterise the model were obtained at midday. Ratiometric indexes were computed for the key surface variables albedo andnet radiation at midday. This allowed point observations of albedo and meandaily net radiation to be scaled across high-resolution images over a largestudy region. Albedo and net radiation estimates were within 5 %–10 % of measured values. A daily evaporation estimate for a grassed surface was 0.5 mm (23 %) larger than eddy covariance measurements. Spatial variations in key factors driving evaporation and their impacts on upscaled evaporation estimates are also discussed. The methods applied have two key advantages for estimating evaporation over previous remote-sensing approaches: (1) detailed daily estimates of actual evaporation can be directly obtained using a physically based evaporation model, and(2) analysis of more-detailed and more-reliable evaporation estimates may lead to improved methods for upscaling evaporative fluxes to larger areas.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.15.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Drought is a recurring extreme climate event and among the mostcostly natural disasters in the world. This is particularly true over Canada,where drought is both a frequent and damaging phenomenon with impacts onregional water resources, agriculture, industry, aquatic ecosystems, andhealth. However, nationwide drought assessments are currently lacking andimpacted by limited ground-based observations. This study provides acomprehensive analysis of historical droughts over the whole of Canada,including the role of large-scale teleconnections. Drought events arecharacterized by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index(SPEI) over various temporal scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 consecutive months,6 months from April to September, and 12 months from October to September)applied to different gridded monthly data sets for the period 1950–2013.The Mann–Kendall test, rotated empirical orthogonal function, continuouswavelet transform, and wavelet coherence analyses are used, respectively, toinvestigate the trend, spatio-temporal patterns, periodicity, andteleconnectivity of drought events. Results indicate that southern (northern)parts of the country experienced significant trends towards drier (wetter)conditions although substantial variability exists. Two spatiallywell-defined regions with different temporal evolution of droughts wereidentified – the Canadian Prairies and northern central Canada. The analysesalso revealed the presence of a dominant periodicity of between 8 and 32 months in the Prairie region and between 8 and 40 months in the northern centralregion. These cycles of low-frequency variability are found to be associatedprincipally with the Pacific–North American (PNA) and Multivariate ElNiño/Southern Oscillation Index (MEI) relative to other consideredlarge-scale climate indices. This study is the first of its kind to identifydominant periodicities in drought variability over the whole of Canada interms of when the drought events occur, their duration, and how often they occur.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.16.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The prediction system models precipitation types explicitly, directly from the Milbrandt–Yau microphysics scheme. It was determined that the freezing rain underprediction for this case was due primarily to excessive refreezing of rain, originating from melting snow and graupel, in and under the temperature inversion of the advancing warm front ultimately depleting the supply of rain reaching the surface. The refreezing was caused from excessive collisional freezing between rain and graupel. Sensitivity experiments were conducted to examine the effects of a temperature threshold for collisional freezing and on varying the values of the collection efficiencies between rain and ice-phase hydrometeors.

In the long term, the net carbon flux between forests and the atmosphere has been significantly impacted by changes in forest cover area and structure due to ecological disturbances and management activities. Current empirical approaches for estimating net ecosystem productivity (NEP) rarely consider forest age as a predictor, which represents variation in physiological processes that can respond differently to environmental drivers, and regrowth following disturbance. Here, we conduct an observational synthesis to empirically determine to what extent climate, soil properties, nitrogen deposition, forest age and management influence the spatial and interannual variability of forest NEP across 126 forest eddy-covariance flux sites worldwide. The empirical models explained up to 62% and 71% of spatio-temporal and across-site variability of annual NEP, respectively. An investigation of model structures revealed that forest age was a dominant factor of NEP spatio-temporal variability in both space and time at the global scale as compared to abiotic factors, such as nutrient availability, soil characteristics and climate. These findings emphasize the importance of forest age in quantifying spatio-temporal variation in NEP using empirical approaches.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.21.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Channel enlargement is a commonly observed effect and channel evolution models can help guide management efforts, but the models must be used in the proper geologic and climatic context. Semi‐alluvial channels characterized by a relatively thin alluvial layer over clay till and a convex channel profile in a temperate climate are not represented in currently available models. In this study we: (i) assess channel enlargement; and (ii) propose a channel evolution model for an urban semi‐alluvial creek in Toronto, Canada. The system is 90% developed with an imperviousness of approximately 47%. Channel enlargement is assessed by comparing 50 year old construction surveys, a recent survey of a relic channel, low‐precision surveys of channel change over a 15 year period, and high‐precision surveys over a three year period. The enlargement ratio of the channel since 1958 is 2.6, but could be as high 8.2 in comparison with the pre‐urban channel. When the increase in flow capacity is considered, the enlargement ratio is 1.9 since 1958 and up to 6.0 in comparison with the pre‐urban channel. Channel enlargement continues in the contemporary channel at an estimated rate of 0.23 m2/year. A five stage model is presented to describe channel evolution in the lower reaches. In this model the coarse lag material from glacial sources provides a natural resilience to the bed and incision occurs only after the increased flows from urbanization are combined with higher slopes as a result of channel straightening or avulsions. Further research should be done to assess stream behaviour close to an identified geologic control point.

While nutrient loss rates had statistically significant relationships with all transport time scale measures, water age had the strongest explanatory power, with water age and nutrient loss rates both smaller in spring and fall and larger in summer. We show that Lake St. Clair is seasonally divided into two discrete regions of contrasting water age and productivity. The north‐western region is dominated by oligotrophic waters from the St. Clair River, and south‐eastern region is dominated by the nutrient enriched, more productive waters from the Thames‐Sydenham River complex. The spatial and temporal variations in local transport scales and nutrient loss rates, coupled with strong seasonal variations in discharge and nutrient loads from the major tributaries, suggest the need for different load reduction strategies for different tributaries.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.24.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Inclusion of community priorities and unique cultural, spiritual, and traditional values harmonize the appearance, location, and functionality of developments with the social and cultural context in which they are built and contribute to holistic wellness. However, co-design processes that align community values and the technical needs of water facilities are difficult to find. A scoping review was conducted to explore the state of knowledge on co-design of water infrastructure in Indigenous Canada to build a knowledge base from which practices and processes could emerge. The scoping results revealed that articles and reports emerged only in recent years, contained case studies and meta-reviews with primary (qualitative) data, and involved community members in various capacities. Overall, 13 articles were reviewed that contributed to understanding co-design for water infrastructure in Indigenous Canada. Barriers to co-design included funding models for Indigenous community infrastructure, difficulties in engineers and designers understanding Indigenous worldviews and paradigms, and a lack of cooperation among stakeholders that contribute to ongoing design failures. A working definition of co-design for Indigenous water infrastructure is presented.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.25.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

We explore this complexity through an example of an existing complex, or wicked, policy problem - the case of agricultural wetland drainage in the Canadian Prairies. Agricultural wetland drainage expands the amount of productive agricultural land, increasing agricultural efficiency and productivity. Drainage is also one of the primary drivers of the loss of Canada’s wetlands and is a hotly contentious issue between actors with divergent views and values in the Canadian Prairies. Using the nuances of drainage as an exemplar, we discuss how fragmented framings of water foster perspectives and solutions that fail to consider the full range of aspects and interactions, and contribute to the enduring conflicts that accompany drainage debates in many regions. First, we discuss agricultural wetland drainage as practiced in the province of Saskatchewan, where significant regulatory and governance changes are in progress. Next, we discuss the challenges of policy and governance fragmentation, both specific to water and to the surrounding system. Finally, we note potential alternative framings that, while specific to prairie water governance, provide guidance for how other complex social-ecological challenges might be approached.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.26.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Wildfires are actively suppressed in areas with higher human influence, but, paradoxically, these areas have more numerous ignitions than low-impact ones because of the high rates of human-ignited fires, especially during the springtime. The aim of this study is to evaluate how humans have altered the temporal patterns of wildfire activity in the Canadian boreal forest by comparing two adjacent areas of low and high human influence, respectively: Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP) and the Lower Athabasca Plains (LAP). We carried out Singular Spectrum Analysis to identify trends and cycles in wildfires from 1970 to 2015 for the two areas and examined their association with climate conditions. We found human influence to be reflected in wildfire activity in multiple ways: (1) by dampening (i.e., for area burned)—and even reversing (i.e., for the number of fires)—the increasing trends of fire activity usually associated with drier and warmer conditions; (2) by shifting the peak of fire activity from the summer to the spring; (3) by altering the fire-climate association; and (4) by exhibiting more recurrent ( 9 years).</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.29.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Global mean sea level is an integral of changes occurring in the climate system in response to unforced climate variability as well as natural and anthropogenic forcing factors. Its temporal evolution allows changes (e.g., acceleration) to be detected in one or more components. Study of the sea-level budget provides constraints on missing or poorly known contributions, such as the unsurveyed deep ocean or the still uncertain land water component. In the context of the World Climate Research Programme Grand Challenge entitled Regional Sea Level and Coastal Impacts, an international effort involving the sea-level community worldwide has been recently initiated with the objective of assessing the various datasets used to estimate components of the sea-level budget during the altimetry era (1993 to present). These datasets are based on the combination of a broad range of space-based and in situ observations, model estimates, and algorithms. Evaluating their quality, quantifying uncertainties and identifying sources of discrepancies between component estimates is extremely useful for various applications in climate research. This effort involves several tens of scientists from about 50 research teams/institutions worldwide (www.wcrp-climate.org/grand-challenges/gc-sea-level, last access: 22 August 2018). The results presented in this paper are a synthesis of the first assessment performed during 2017–2018. We present estimates of the altimetry-based global mean sea level (average rate of 3.1 ± 0.3 mm yr−1 and acceleration of 0.1 mm yr−2 over 1993–present), as well as of the different components of the sea-level budget (http://doi.org/10.17882/54854, last access: 22 August 2018). We further examine closure of the sea-level budget, comparing the observed global mean sea level with the sum of components. Ocean thermal expansion, glaciers, Greenland and Antarctica contribute 42 %, 21 %, 15 % and 8 % to the global mean sea level over the 1993–present period. We also study the sea-level budget over 2005–present, using GRACE-based ocean mass estimates instead of the sum of individual mass components. Our results demonstrate that the global mean sea level can be closed to within 0.3 mm yr−1 (1σ). Substantial uncertainty remains for the land water storage component, as shown when examining individual mass contributions to sea level.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.30.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

A workflow (i.e., a pipeline) is a finite set of processing modules organized as a series of steps that is applied to an input dataset to produce a desired output. In a workflow management system, users generally create workflows manually for their own investigations. However, workflows can sometimes be lengthy and the constituent processing modules might often be computationally expensive. In this situation, it would be beneficial if users could reuse intermediate stage results generated by previously executed workflows for executing their current workflow.In this paper, we propose a novel technique based on association rule mining for suggesting which intermediate stage results from a workflow that a user is going to execute should be stored for reusing in the future. We call our proposed technique, RISP (Recommending Intermediate States from Pipelines). According to our investigation on hundreds of workflows from two scientific workflow management systems, our proposed technique can efficiently suggest intermediate state results to store for future reuse. The results that are suggested to be stored have a high reuse frequency. Moreover, for creating around 51% of the entire pipelines, we can reuse results suggested by our technique. Finally, we can achieve a considerable gain (74% gain) in execution time by reusing intermediate results stored by the suggestions provided by our proposed technique. We believe that our technique (RISP) has the potential to have a significant positive impact on Big-Data systems, because it can considerably reduce execution time of the workflows through appropriate reuse of intermediate state results, and hence, can improve the performance of the systems.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.31.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

However, methods to estimate ha from data are limited. This synthesis evaluates the applicability and robustness of the calculation of ha from eddy covariance momentum‐flux data. At 69 forest sites, annual ha robustly predicted site‐to‐site and year‐to‐year differences in canopy heights (R2 = 0.88, 111 site‐years). At 23 cropland/grassland sites, weekly ha successfully captured the dynamics of vegetation canopies over growing seasons (R2 > 0.70 in 74 site‐years). Our results demonstrate the potential of flux‐derived ha determination for tracking the seasonal, interannual, and/or decadal dynamics of vegetation canopies including growth, harvest, land use change, and disturbance. The large‐scale and time‐varying ha derived from flux networks worldwide provides a new benchmark for regional and global Earth system models and satellite remote sensing of canopy structure.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.35.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

In salt water environments, eutrophication has been linked to anthropogenic N inputs (Gruber and Galloway, 2008; Congreves and Van Eerd, 2015). Eutrophication is problematic as it impacts both ecosystem and human health (Anderson et al., 2002), which reduces the recreational value of lakes as well as their potential use as drinking water sources (Smith et al., 1998, 2015). Consequently, there is significant pressure to reduce the export of P and N from surrounding watersheds (International Joint Commission, 2014). Although researchers and environmental managers have attempted to manage nutrient export for decades (Sharpley et al., 1994), the occurrence of large algal blooms has increased due to a combination of climate drivers as well as the large intensity of agricultural land use in surrounding watersheds (e.g. Michalak et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2015). There is also evidence that the elevated P loads from agricultural systems may be an unintended consequence of conservation practices (Jarvie et al., 2017). Thus, an improved understanding of the efficacy of best management practices (BMPs) is needed, and potential unintended consequences must be identified and quantified. The use of CC is a conservation practice that is growing in popularity (Wayman et al., 2016; Statistics Canada, 2017). Cover crops are plants grown by farmers for their benefits to the soil, environment, and future crop yields (Snapp et al., 2005; Blanco-Canqui et al., 2015). Cover crops have the benefit of reducing particulate P losses associated with soil erosion; however, concern has been raised about their potential to release dissolved reactive P (Tukey, 1970; Sharpley et al., 1994; Sturite et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2014). Phosphorus loss through leaching is typically minor; however, certain conditions and mechanical processes have been found to increase the concentration of nutrients in leachate (Tukey and Morgan, 1963; Bechmann et al., 2005; Lozier and Macrae, 2017; Lozier et al., 2017). Of particular importance for northern temperate regions is the effect of freezing on P release from plants, Nutrient Release from Living and Terminated Cover Crops Under Variable Freeze–Thaw Cycles</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.36.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Transfer functions are generally used to adjust for the wind-induced undercatch of solid precipitation measurements. These functions are derived based on the variation of the collection efficiency with wind speed for a particular type of gauge, either using field experiments or based on numerical simulation. Most studies use the wind speed alone, while others also include surface air temperature and/or precipitation type to try to reduce the scatter of the residuals at a given wind speed. In this study, we propose the use of the measured precipitation intensity to improve the effectiveness of the transfer function. This is achieved by applying optimized curve fitting to field measurements from the Marshall field-test site (CO, USA). The use of a non-gradient optimization algorithm ensures optimal binning of experimental data according to the parameter under test. The results reveal that using precipitation intensity as an explanatory variable significantly reduce the scatter of the residuals. The scatter reduction as indicated by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is confirmed by the analysis of the recent quality controlled data from the WMO/SPICE campaign, showing that this approach can be applied to a variety of locations and catching-type gauges. We demonstrate the physical basis of the relationship between the collection efficiency and the measured precipitation intensity, due to the correlation of large particles with high intensities, by conducting a Computational Fluid-Dynamics (CFD) simulation. We use a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes SST k-ω model coupled with a Lagrangian particle-tracking model. Results validate the hypothesis of using the measured precipitation intensity as a key parameter to improve the correction of wind-induced undercatch. Findings have the potential to improve operational measurements since no additional instrument other than a wind sensor is required to apply the correction. This improves the accuracy of precipitation measurements without the additional cost of ancillary instruments such as particle counters.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.37.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

By definition, the active layer is the layer above permafrost that freezes and thaws annually. This study, conducted in peatlands of subarctic Canada, in the zone of thawing discontinuous permafrost, demonstrates that the entire thickness of ground atop permafrost does not always refreeze over winter. In these instances, a talik exists between the permafrost and active layer, and ALT must therefore be measured by the depth of refreeze at the end of winter. As talik thickness increases at the expense of the underlying permafrost, ALT is shown to simultaneously decrease. This suggests that the active layer has a maximum thickness that is controlled by the amount of energy lost from the ground to the atmosphere during winter. The taliks documented in this study are relatively thin (&lt;2 m) and exist on forested peat plateaus. The presence of taliks greatly affects the stability of the underlying permafrost. Vertical permafrost thaw was found to be significantly greater in areas with taliks (0.07 m year−1) than without (0.01 m year−1). Furthermore, the spatial distribution of areas with taliks increased between 2011 and 2015 from 20% to 48%, a phenomenon likely caused by an anomalously large ground heat flux input in 2012. Rapid talik development and accelerated permafrost thaw indicates that permafrost loss may exhibit a nonlinear response to warming temperatures. Documentation of refreeze depths and talik development is needed across the circumpolar north.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.38.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This study has investigated the challenges in specifying the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat to snowpacks in forest clearings. The snowpack in two forest clearings in the Canadian Rockies was simulated using a one-dimensional (1D) snowpack model. A trade-off was found between optimizing against measured snow surface temperature or snowmelt when choosing how to specify the turbulent fluxes. Schemes using the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory tended to produce negatively biased surface temperature, while schemes that enhanced turbulent fluxes, to reduce the surface temperature bias, resulted in too much melt. Uncertainty estimates from Monte Carlo experiments showed that no realistic parameter set could successfully remove biases in both surface temperature and melt. A simple scheme that excludes atmospheric stability correction was required to successfully simulate surface temperature under low wind speed conditions. Nonturbulent advective fluxes and/or nonlocal sources of turbulence are thought to account for the maintenance of heat exchange in low-wind conditions. The simulation of snowmelt was improved by allowing enhanced latent heat fluxes during low-wind conditions. Caution is warranted when snowpack models are optimized on surface temperature, as model tuning may compensate for deficiencies in conceptual and numerical models of radiative, conductive, and turbulent heat exchange at the snow surface and within the snowpack. Such model tuning could have large impacts on the melt rate and timing of the snow-free transition in simulations of forest clearings within hydrological and meteorological models.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.39.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

In addition to contributing to the maintenance of wetland ecology, including aquatic animals and waterfowl, ice jams provide essential moisture and nutrient replenishment to perched lakes and ponds in northern inland deltas. However, river ice-jam flooding can have detrimental impacts on in-stream aquatic ecosystems, cause damage to property and infrastructure, and present hazards to riverside communities. In order to maintain sustainable communities and ecosystems, ice-jam flooding must be both mitigated and promoted. This study reviews various flood management strategies used worldwide, and points to the knowledge gaps in these strategies. The main objective of the paper is to provide a framework for a sustainable ice-jam flood management strategy in order to better protect riverine socio-economic and socio-ecological systems. Sustainable flood management must be a carefully adopted and integrated strategy that includes both economic and ecological perspectives in order to mitigate ice-jam flooding in riverside socio-economic systems, while at the same time promoting ice-jam flooding of riverine socio-ecological systems such as inland deltas.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.41.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The ability of these tree species to regenerate within both upland and wetland areas of the BP following wildfire is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of fire on nutrient dynamics in soil and water in peatlands and forested landscapes in the BP and relate this to aspen regeneration. Nutrient concentrations, nutrient supply rates, and net nutrient mineralization rates were determined in burned and unburned sections of a peatland and forest and compared with the regeneration of aspen. NO3−, NH4+, and P varied spatially throughout the landscape, and differences were observed between peatland and upland areas. In general, differences in nutrient dynamics were not observed between burned and unburned areas, with the exception of P. Nutrient and growth data suggest that aspen do not require nutrient‐rich conditions for regeneration and instead relied on forest litter to satisfy nutrient demands. Although the peatlands contained high nutrients, aspen did not flourish in the combination of anoxic and aerobic organic‐rich soils present in this area. Although aspen may use peat water and nutrients through their rooting zones, peatlands are unsuitable for aspen re‐establishment in the long‐term. However, the combination of abundant nutrients in surface mineral soils in peat margins may indicate the vulnerability of margins to upland transformations in later successional stages.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.43.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

While the initial phases focus on field and airborne data collection, early integration with modeling activities is important to benefit future modeling syntheses. We compiled feedback from ecosystem modeling teams on key data needs, which encompass carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance dynamics. A suite of variables was identified as part of this activity with a critical requirement that they are collected concurrently and representatively over space and time. Individual projects in ABoVE may not capture all these needs, and thus there is both demand and opportunity for the augmentation of field observations, and synthesis of the observations that are collected, to ensure that science questions and integrated modeling activities are successfully implemented.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.44.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

These interactions create a moisture–nutrient gradient within the surface soils, increasing along low‐relief transitions from upland to riparian zone, and in turn influence the distribution of vegetation communities. It is not yet known if/when analogous ecohydrological functions can be achieved in constructed uplands following industrial disturbance, such as that following oil sands development. Hence, to assess this, we studied interactions between hydrogeochemical processes and vegetation colonization in a constructed upland relative to hydrophysical properties of 2 reclamation cover substrates during a typical continental climate's growing season. Our results indicated that in 3 years of postconstruction, the establishment of a moisture–nutrient gradient that supports vegetation colonization along slope positions was still limited by heterogeneity of cover substrates. Portions of the upland under peat–mineral mix were characterized by lower nutrient availability, high moisture content, and establishment of planted shrubs and trees. In contrast, forest floor materials plots were characterized by poor soil quality, but higher nutrient availability and greater colonization of invasive grasses and native shrubs. We suggest that the colonization of underdeveloped soils by invasive grasses may facilitate pedogenic processes and thus should be accepted by reclamation managers as a successional milestone in the recovery of ecohydrological functioning of constructed uplands. Poor soil structure under forest floor materials could not support edaphic conditions required by plants to efficiently utilize fertilizer, making this practise futile at the early stage of soil development.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.47.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Its cleavage activity selectively requires Ag+ ions, and thus it has been used as a sensor for Ag+ detection. However, the previous selection yielded very limited information regarding its sequence requirement, since only ∼0.1% of the population in the final library were related to Ag10c and most other sequences were inactive. In this work, we performed a reselection by randomizing the 19 important nucleotides in Ag10c in such a way that a purine has an equal chance of being A or G, whereas a pyrimidine has an equal chance of being T or C. The round 3 library of the reselection was carefully analyzed and a statistic understanding of the relative importance of each nucleotide was obtained. At the same time, a more active mutant was identified, containing two mutated nucleotides. Further analysis indicated new base pairs leading to an enzyme with smaller catalytic loops but with ∼200% activity of the original Ag10c, and also excellent selectivity for Ag+. Therefore, a more active mutant of Ag10c was obtained and further truncations were successfully performed, which might be better candidates for developing new biosensors for silver. A deeper biochemical understanding was also obtained using this reselection method.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.48.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Scatterometer observations identify two physical sources of backscatter from the ice cover: the snow–ice and ice–water interfaces. Backscatter time series at all frequencies show increases from the ice–water interface prior to the inclusion of tubular bubbles in the ice column based on in situ observations, indicating scattering mechanisms independent of double-bounce scatter. The co-polarized phase difference of interactions at the ice–water interface from both scatterometer and SAR observations is centered at 0° during the time series, also indicating a scattering regime other than double bounce. A Yamaguchi three-component decomposition of the RADARSAT-2 C-band time series is presented, which suggests the dominant scattering mechanism to be single-bounce off the ice–water interface with appreciable surface roughness or preferentially oriented facets, regardless of the presence, absence, or density of tubular bubble inclusions. This paper builds on newly established evidence of single-bounce scattering mechanism for freshwater lake ice and is the first to present a winter time series of ground-based and spaceborne fully polarimetric active microwave observations with polarimetric decompositions for bubbled freshwater lake ice.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.49.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

We argue that (a) performance metric‐based approaches to parameter GSA are actually identifiability analyses, (b) the use of a performance metric to assess sensitivity unavoidably distorts the information provided by the model about relative parameter importance, and (c) it is a serious conceptual flaw to interpret the results of such an analysis as being consistent and accurate indications of the sensitivity of the model response to parameter perturbations. Further, because such approaches depend on availability of system state/output observational data, the analysis they provide is necessarily incomplete. Here we frame the GSA problem from first principles, using trajectories of the partial derivatives of model outputs with respect to controlling factors as the theoretical basis for sensitivity, and construct a global sensitivity matrix from which statistical indices of total period time‐aggregate parameter importance, and time series of time‐varying parameter importance, can be inferred. We demonstrate this framework using the HBV‐SASK conceptual hydrologic model applied to the Oldman basin in Canada and show that it disagrees with performance metric‐based methods regarding which parameters exert the strongest controls on model behavior. Further, it is highly efficient, requiring less than 1,000 base samples to obtain stable and robust parameter importance assessments for our 10‐parameter example.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.50.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

However, there is a growing need for regional, continental, and global scale indices to assess the potential effect of wildfires on freshwater availability and water supply resilience. Such indices must consider both the individual and compound effects of wildfires.

The importance of stubble in trapping wind-blown snow and retaining winter snowfall has been well demonstrated. However, stubble is not explicitly accounted for in hydrological or energy balance snowmelt models. This paper relates measurable stubble parameters (height, width, areal density, and albedo) to the snowpack energy balance and snowmelt with the new, physically based Stubble–Snow–Atmosphere Model (SSAM). Novel process representations of SSAM quantify the attenuation of shortwave radiation by exposed stubble, the sky and vegetation view factors needed to solve longwave radiation terms, and a resistance scheme for stubble–snow–atmosphere fluxes to solve for surface temperatures and turbulent fluxes. SSAM results were compared to observations of radiometric snow-surface temperature, stubble temperature, snow-surface solar irradiance, areal-average turbulent fluxes, and snow water equivalent from two intensive field campaigns during snowmelt in 2015 and 2016 over wheat and canola stubble in Saskatchewan, Canada. Uncalibrated SSAM simulations compared well with these observations, providing confidence in the model structure and parameterization. A sensitivity analysis conducted using SSAM revealed compensatory relationships in energy balance terms that result in a small increase in net snowpack energy as stubble exposure increases.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.53.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This study examines the internal structure and hydrogeological characteristics of an inactive rock glacier in the Canadian Rockies using geophysical imaging techniques, analysis of the discharge hydrograph of the spring draining the rock glacier, and chemical and stable isotopic compositions of source waters. The results show that the coarse blocky sediments forming the rock glacier allow the rapid infiltration of snowmelt and rain water to an unconfined aquifer above the bedrock surface. The water flowing through the aquifer is eventually routed via an internal channel parallel to the front of the rock glacier to a spring, which provides baseflow to a headwater stream designated as a critical habitat for an at‐risk cold‐water fish species. Discharge from the rock glacier spring contributes up to 50% of basin streamflow during summer baseflow periods and up to 100% of basin streamflow over winter, despite draining less than 20% of the watershed area. The rock glacier contains patches of ground ice even though it may have been inactive for thousands of years, suggesting the resiliency of the ground thermal regime under a warming climate.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.54.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

In spite of advantages of no‐till systems, this practice may result in excess infiltration into the soil and can enhance the movement of mobile nutrients and some pesticides to subsurface drains and groundwater along preferential pathways. The goal of this study was to evaluate the capacity of DRAINMOD‐N II to simulate subsurface nitrate‐N leaching in no‐till fields in Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada, from 2003 to 2006. The model performance was first evaluated by comparing observed and simulated drain outflow data that is an essential prerequisite for the model to obtain a proper prediction of NO3‐N movement, and then by comparing observed and simulated NO3‐N concentration in no‐till fields using three statistical indices, relative root mean square error (RRMSE), average absolute deviation (AAD) and the correlation coefficient (R2). The RRMSE, AAD and R2 for the validation period were determined to be 1.09, 1.85 and 0.83 mm for drain outflow, and 1.43, 0.51 and 0.79 mg l−1 for NO3‐N concentration respectively. The results showed that DRAINMOD‐N II predicted NO3‐N leaching reasonably well in drainage outflow of no‐till fields over the whole period.

The Lake O'Hara watershed in the Canadian Rockies has been the site of several hydrologicalinvestigations. It has been instrumented to a degree uncommon for many alpinestudy watersheds. Air temperature, relative humidity, wind, precipitation,radiation, and snow depth are measured at two meteorological stations nearLake O'Hara and in the higher elevation Opabin Plateau. Water levels at LakeO'Hara, Opabin Lake, and several stream gauging stations are recorded usingpressure transducers and validated against manual measurements.Stage–discharge rating curves were determined at gauging stations and usedto calculate discharge from stream stage. The database includes additionaldata such as water chemistry (temperature, electrical conductivity, andstable isotope abundance) and snow survey (snow depth and density) for selectyears, as well as geospatial data (elevation and land cover). This datasetwill be useful for the future study of alpine regions, where substantial andlong-term hydrological datasets are scarce due to difficult field conditions.The dataset can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.20383/101.035.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.56.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

By using a double mutant based on the Ce13d DNAzyme, and by lowering the temperature, increased 2-aminopurine (2AP) fluorescence was observed with addition of both Na+ and K+. The fluorescence increase was similar for these two metals at below 10 mM, after which K+ took a different pathway. Since 2AP probes its local base stacking environment, K+ can be considered to induce misfolding. Binding of both Na+ and K+ was specific, since single base mutations could fully inhibit 2AP fluorescence for both metals. The binding thermodynamics was measured by temperature-dependent experiments revealing enthalpy-driven binding for both metals and less coordination sites compared to G-quadruplex DNA. Cleavage activity assays indicated a moderate cleavage activity with 10 mM K+, while further increase of K+ inhibited the activity, also supporting its misfolding of the DNAzyme. For comparison, a G-quadruplex DNA was also studied using the same system, where Na+ and K+ led to the same final state with only around 8-fold difference in Kd. This study provides interesting insights into strategies for discriminating Na+ and K+.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.57.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This article presents the development of a sub-hourly database ofhydrometeorological conditions collected in British Columbia's (BC's) CaribooMountains and surrounding area extending from 2006 to present. The CaribooAlpine Mesonet (CAMnet) forms a network of 11 active hydrometeorologicalstations positioned at strategic locations across mid- to high elevations ofthe Cariboo Mountains. This mountain region spans 44 150 km2, forming thenorthern extension of the Columbia Mountains. Deep fjord lakes along withold-growth western redcedar and hemlock forests reside in the lower valleys,montane forests of Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine and subalpine firpermeate the mid-elevations, while alpine tundra, glaciers and severallarge ice fields cover the higher elevations. The automatic weather stationstypically measure air and soil temperature, relative humidity, atmosphericpressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall and snow depth at 15 minintervals. Additional measurements at some stations include shortwave andlongwave radiation, near-surface air, skin, snow, or water temperature, andsoil moisture, among others. Details on deployment sites, theinstrumentation used and its precision, the collection and quality controlprocess are provided. Instructions on how to access the database at Zenodo,an online public data repository, are also furnished(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1195043).

In a subhumid climate, hydrogeological position is an important control on peatland hydrology and wildfire vulnerability. Consequently, we hypothesized that in a coarse‐textured glaciofluvial outwash, isolated peatlands lacking the moderating effect of large‐scale groundwater flow would have greater water table (WT) variability and would also be more vulnerable to deep WT drawdown and wildfire during dry climate cycles. A holistic approach was taken to evaluate 3 well‐accepted factors that are associated with smouldering in boreal peatlands: hollow microform coverage, peatland margin morphometry, and gravimetric water content. Using a combination of field measurements (bulk density, humification, WT position, hummock–hollow distribution, and margin width) and modelling (1‐D vertical unsaturated flow coupled with a simple peat–fuel energy balance equation), we assessed the vulnerability of peat to smouldering. We found that a peatland in the regionally intermediate topographic position is the most vulnerable to smouldering due to the interaction of variable connectivity to large‐scale groundwater flow and the absence of mineral stratigraphy for limiting WT declines during dry conditions. Our findings represent a novel assessment framework and tool for fire managers by providing a priori knowledge of potential peat smouldering hot spot locations in the landscape to efficiently allocate resources and reduce emergency response time to smouldering events.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.61.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Findings of increasing groundwater levels, however, are at odds with reports of well failure and decreases in the land area irrigated from shallow wells. We argue that recently reported results are skewed by the problem of survivor bias, with dry or defunct wells being systematically excluded from trend analyses due to missing data. We hypothesize that these dry wells carry critical information about groundwater stress that is missed when data are filtered. Indeed, we find strong correlations between missing well data and metrics related to climate stress and groundwater development, indicative of a systemic bias. Using two alternative metrics, which take into account information from dry and defunct wells, our results demonstrate increasing groundwater stress in South India. Our refined approach for identifying groundwater depletion hot spots is critical for policy interventions and resource allocation.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.62.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Such a coupling is termed as evolutionary coupling in the literature. The concept of traditional evolutionary coupling restricts us to assume coupling among only those entities that changed together in the past. The entities that did not co-change in the past might also have coupling. However, such couplings can not be retrieved using the current concept of detecting evolutionary coupling in the literature. In this paper, we investigate whether we can detect such couplings by applying transitive rules on the evolutionary couplings detected using the traditional mechanism. We call these couplings that we detect using our proposed mechanism as transitive evolutionary couplings. According to our research on thousands of revisions of four subject systems, transitive evolutionary couplings combined with the traditional ones provide us with 13.96% higher recall and 5.56% higher precision in detecting future co-change candidates when compared with a state-of-the-art technique.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.63.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This site contains approximately 695,000 m3 of sediment contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals. The complex Randle Reef sediment remediation project is finally coming to fruition after more than 30 years of study, discussion, collaborations, stakeholder consensus-building, and debate. This paper unravels the reasons behind the delays associated with implementing sediment management at the Randle Reef site. In-depth interviews with experts and professionals from organizations who are/were involved in the project were conducted to identify the nature of performance in five theme areas that are important for successful action namely: (1) participation of appropriate actors with common objectives; (2) funding and resources; (3) decision-making process; (4) research and technology development; and (5) public and political support. It is evident from this study that the hurdles to progress with addressing contaminated sediment sites involve technical, political, regulatory as well as social challenges. We offer potential solutions and a series of recommendations based on experts' first-hand experience with the management of such complex sites to inform how future remediation projects can overcome obstacles.

Many metal-dependent DNAzymes have been selected for RNA cleavage. Herein, we report that the Ce13d DNAzyme can use nonmetallic iodine (I2) to cleave a phosphorothioate (PS)-modified substrate. The cleavage yield exceeded 60% for both the Rp and Sp stereoisomers in 10 s, while the yield without the enzyme strand was only ∼10%. The Ce13d cleavage with I2 also required Na+, consistent with the property of Ce13d and confirming the similar role of I2 as a metal ion. Ce13d had the highest yield among eight tested DNAzymes, with the second highest DNAzyme showing only 20% cleavage. The incomplete cleavage was due to competition from desulfurization and isomerization reactions. This DNAzyme was engineered for fluorescence-based I2 detection. With EDTA for masking metal ions, I2 was selectively detected down to 4.7 nM. Oxidation of I- with Fe3+ produced I2 in situ, allowing detection of Fe3+ down to 78 nM. By harnessing nonelectrostatic interactions, such as the I2/sulfur interaction observed here, more nonmetal species might be discovered to assist DNAzyme-based RNA cleavage.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.65.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Peatlands tend to have shallow water tables, and the position and tendency of the water table to fluctuate (i.e., stability) is a factor controlling the system's ability to store carbon and water. Many peatland environments, especially fens, offer ideal habitat for beaver, and the potential for beaver dams to influence this link by manipulating water tables requires investigation. Our objective was to determine the influence of beaver dams on the water table dynamics of a Rocky Mountain fen. We monitored water tables in the peatland for 4 years while beaver dams were intact and 2 years after they were breached by an extreme flood event. We found that, because of the unique way in which dams were built, they connected the peatland to the stream and raised and stabilized already high water tables within a 150‐m radius. Beaver‐mediated changes to peatland water table regimes have the potential to enhance carbon sequestration and the peatland's ability to respond to external pressures such as climate change. Furthermore, beaver dams increased surface and groundwater storage, which has implications for regional water balances, especially in times of drought.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.67.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

As changes in risk are often associated with changes in exposure due to projected changes in local or regional climate extremes, we analyze differences in the risks of extreme daily temperatures and extreme daily precipitation amounts under different warming limits. We show that global warming of 2°C would result in substantially larger changes in the probabilities of the extreme events than global warming of 1.5°C. For example, over the global land area, the probability of a warm extreme that occurs once every 20 years on average in the current climate is projected to increase 130% and 340% at the 1.5°C and 2.0°C warming levels, respectively (median values). Moreover, the relative changes in probability are larger for rarer, more extreme events, implying that risk assessments need to carefully consider the extreme event thresholds at which vulnerabilities occur.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.68.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The expansion of agricultural tile drainage in the Northern Great Plains of North America is occurring, yet is controversial due to persistent water quality problems such as eutrophication. Runoff‐generating mechanisms in North American tile‐drained landscapes in vertisolic soils have not been investigated but are important for understanding the impacts of tile drainage on water quantity and quality. This study evaluated the role of climate drivers on the activation of overland (OF) and tile (TF) flow and groundwater flow responses (GWT) on tile‐drained and nontile‐drained farm fields in Southern Manitoba, Canada. The response times of different flow paths (OF, TF, and GWT) were compared for 23 hydrological events (April–September 2015, 2016) to infer dominant runoff generation processes. Runoff responses (all pathways) were more rapid following higher intensity rainfall. Subsurface responses were hastened by wetter antecedent conditions in spring and delayed by the seasonal soil–ice layer. The activation of OF did not differ between the tiled and nontiled fields, suggesting that tile drains do little to reduce the occurrence of OF in this landscape. Rapid vertical preferential flow into tiles via preferential flow pathways was uncommon at our site, and the soil profile instead wet up from the top down. These conclusions have implications for the expansion of tile drainage and the impact of such an expansion on hydrological and biogeochemical processes in agricultural landscapes.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.70.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Surface water and groundwater flow are simulated for the period 2014–2080 under four climate scenarios: median (M), double precipitation (DP), no change in precipitation (NP), and double temperature (DT) and with the assumption of no change in the extent of mine activities after 2013. The results demonstrate that the annual growing season duration is longer and snowmelt happens earlier in the year 2080. During the growing season, the daily proportion of connected hydrologic units (DPCUs) remains approximately the same in the future under the different climate scenarios. It appears that around 68% of watershed area, mostly in western and central eastern portions, will be frequently connected (annual proportion of connected days [APCD] ≥ 20%) in the future. This area remains hydrologically connected for more than 20–50% of the year. Results also show that mining areas are located in infrequently connected areas (APCD &lt; 20%), where DPCU values are significantly lower than other areas. DPCUs in forestlands are more stable with a growing season, that is, ~15 days longer than in wetlands. Comparisons between hydrologic responses in 2016 and 2080 show that, in 2080, maximum snow depths are about 0.7 times smaller, evapotranspiration is ~0.05 mm higher, capillary soil moisture in DT and NP scenarios are 1.01–1.52 mm lower, and the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration is almost the same during the growing season. However, at the end of growing season, the ratio is ~1 unit less in 2080 in DT and NP scenarios. Results also demonstrate that thinner surficial geological layers in the mining areas (located mostly in downstream part of the watershed) lead to their lower hydrologic connectivities. Therefore, these areas are more vulnerable to mining activity impacts, and their hydrologic response under a changing climate should be considered in reclamation planning.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.71.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

However, subcanopy soil‐surface temperatures have been, to date, characterized through isolated, spatially discrete measurements. Using spatially complex forested northern peatlands as an exemplar ecosystem, we explore the high‐resolution spatiotemporal thermal behavior of this critical interface and its response to disturbances by using Fiber‐Optic Distributed Temperature Sensing. Soil‐surface thermal patterning was identified from 1.9 million temperature measurements under undisturbed, trees removed and vascular subcanopy removed conditions. Removing layers of the structurally diverse vegetation canopy not only increased mean temperatures but it shifted the spatial and temporal distribution, range, and longevity of thermal hot spots and hot moments. We argue that linking hot spots and/or hot moments with spatially variable ecosystem processes and feedbacks is key for predicting ecosystem function and resilience.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.73.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Various studies have used the historical relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature (temperature scaling) to provide guidance about precipitation extremes in a future warmer climate. Here we assess how much information is required to robustly identify temperature scaling relationships, and whether these relationships are equally effective at different times in the future in estimating precipitation extremes everywhere across North America. Using a large ensemble of 35 North American regional climate simulations of the period 1951–2100, we show that individual climate simulations of length comparable to that of typical instrumental records are unable to constrain temperature scaling relationships well enough to reliably estimate future extremes of local precipitation accumulation for hourly to daily durations in the model's climate. Hence, temperature scaling relationships estimated from the limited historical observations are unlikely to be able to provide reliable guidance for future adaptation planning at local spatial scales. In contrast, well‐constrained temperature scaling relations based on multiple regional climate simulations do provide a feasible basis for accurately projecting precipitation extremes of hourly to daily durations in different future periods over more than 90% of the North American land area.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.74.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

While assessing the organisms can provide a comprehensive measure of a river's ecological status, it is limited by the traditional morphotaxonomy-based biomonitoring. Recent advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding allow to identify prokaryotes and eukaryotes in one sequencing run, and could thus allow unprecedented resolution. Whether such eDNA-based data can be used directly to predict the pollution status of rivers as a complementation of environmental data remains unknown. Here we used eDNA metabarcoding to explore the main stressors of rivers along which community structure changes, and to identify the method's potential for predicting pollution status based on eDNA data. We showed that a broad range of taxa in bacterial, protistan, and metazoan communities could be profiled with eDNA. Nutrients were the main driving stressor affecting communities' structure, alpha diversity, and the ecological network. We specifically observed that the relative abundance of indicative OTUs was significantly correlated with nutrient levels. These OTUs data could be used to predict the nutrient status up to 79% accuracy on testing data sets. Thus, our study gives a novel approach to predicting the pollution status of rivers by eDNA data.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.76.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Previous work mainly evaluated the relationship between satellite‐observed SIF and gridded GPP products both based on coarse spatial resolutions. Finer resolution SIF (1.3 km × 2.25 km) measured from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐2 (OCO‐2) provides the first opportunity to examine the SIF–GPP relationship at the ecosystem scale using flux tower GPP data. However, it remains unclear how strong the relationship is for each biome and whether a robust, universal relationship exists across a variety of biomes. Here we conducted the first global analysis of the relationship between OCO‐2 SIF and tower GPP for a total of 64 flux sites across the globe encompassing eight major biomes. OCO‐2 SIF showed strong correlations with tower GPP at both midday and daily timescales, with the strongest relationship observed for daily SIF at the 757 nm (R2 = 0.72, p &lt; 0.0001). Strong linear relationships between SIF and GPP were consistently found for all biomes (R2 = 0.57–0.79, p &lt; 0.0001) except evergreen broadleaf forests (R2 = 0.16, p &lt; 0.05) at the daily timescale. A higher slope was found for C4 grasslands and croplands than for C3 ecosystems. The generally consistent slope of the relationship among biomes suggests a nearly universal rather than biome‐specific SIF–GPP relationship, and this finding is an important distinction and simplification compared to previous results. SIF was mainly driven by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and was also influenced by environmental stresses (temperature and water stresses) that determine photosynthetic light use efficiency. OCO‐2 SIF generally had a better performance for predicting GPP than satellite‐derived vegetation indices and a light use efficiency model. The universal SIF–GPP relationship can potentially lead to more accurate GPP estimates regionally or globally. Our findings revealed the remarkable ability of finer resolution SIF observations from OCO‐2 and other new or future missions (e.g., TROPOMI, FLEX) for estimating terrestrial photosynthesis across a wide variety of biomes and identified their potential and limitations for ecosystem functioning and carbon cycle studies.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.78.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The coherence of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) conveys important information on variations of river ice characteristics. However, limited research has been conducted to determine the coherence of multi-frequency L-band ALOS-1 PALSAR, C-band Sentinel-1, and Radarsat-2 images, for such applications. This study was piloted using imagery acquired from the Slave River Delta, Canada, to fill this knowledge gap. The findings were validated using ice core data extracted near Fort Smith. The results indicate that the revisit interval of the satellite is a governing factor of InSAR coherence loss. The ALOS-1 PALSAR images have the smallest coherence mainly due to the 46-day revisit interval and are the least promising for monitoring spatiotemporal variations of river ice covers. Coherence of both Sentinel-1A with a 12-day revisit interval and Radarsat-2 images with a 24-day revisit interval is an important aid for determining safe ice crossings.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.79.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The monitoring of river ice development is a crucial guidance indicator to establish safe crossings along river ice covers. This is the first study, based on our knowledge, to understand the interactions between river ice cover structures and radar signals and to further monitor ice development using C-band synthetic aperture radar images. The study was applied to the Slave River, Canada, using the Freeman–Durden decomposition of quad-pol C-band Radarsat-2 FQ14W images and ice core crystallography analysis. Results demonstrate that the combination of volume and surface scattering can be used to monitor ice cover development that cannot be interpreted from single polarization images, such as Radarsat-2 spotlight images used in this study. These results indicate that the decomposed quad-pol Radarsat-2 images can provide a more effective guide than the single-pol Radarsat-2 SLA images to select safe ice transportation routes. This decomposition approach can be extended to other snow and ice covered rivers.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.81.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Suspended sediments impact stream water quality by increasing theturbidity and acting as a vector for strongly sorbing pollutants.Understanding their sources is of great importance to developing appropriateriver management strategies. In this study, we present an integrated sedimenttransport model composed of a catchment-scale hydrological model to predictriver discharge, a river-hydraulics model to obtain shear stresses in thechannel, a sediment-generating model, and a river sediment-transport model.We use this framework to investigate the sediment contributions fromcatchment and in-stream processes in the Ammer catchment close toTübingen in southwestern Germany. The model is calibrated to stream flowand suspended-sediment concentrations. We use the monthly meansuspended-sediment load to analyze seasonal variations of differentprocesses. The contributions of catchment and in-stream processes to thetotal loads are demonstrated by model simulations under different flowconditions. The evaluation of shear stresses by the river-hydraulics modelallows the identification of hotspots and hot moments of bed erosion for the main stemof the Ammer River. The results suggest that the contributions ofsuspended-sediment loads from urban areas and in-stream processes are higherin the summer months, while deposition has small variations with a slightincrease in summer months. The sediment input from agricultural land andurban areas as well as bed and bank erosion increase with an increase in flowrates. Bed and bank erosion are negligible when flow is smaller than thecorresponding thresholds of 1.5 and 2.5 times the mean discharge,respectively. The bed-erosion rate is higher during the summer months andvaries along the main stem. Over the simulated time period, net sedimenttrapping is observed in the Ammer River. The present work is the basis tostudy particle-facilitated transport of pollutants in the system, helping tounderstand the fate and transport of sediments and sediment-bound pollutants.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.82.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Soils in Arctic and boreal ecosystems store twice as much carbon as the atmosphere, a portion of which may be released as high-latitude soils warm. Some of the uncertainty in the timing and magnitude of the permafrost–climate feedback stems from complex interactions between ecosystem properties and soil thermal dynamics. Terrestrial ecosystems fundamentally regulate the response of permafrost to climate change by influencing surface energy partitioning and the thermal properties of soil itself. Here we review how Arctic and boreal ecosystem processes influence thermal dynamics in permafrost soil and how these linkages may evolve in response to climate change. While many of the ecosystem characteristics and processes affecting soil thermal dynamics have been examined individually (e.g., vegetation, soil moisture, and soil structure), interactions among these processes are less understood. Changes in ecosystem type and vegetation characteristics will alter spatial patterns of interactions between climate and permafrost. In addition to shrub expansion, other vegetation responses to changes in climate and rapidly changing disturbance regimes will affect ecosystem surface energy partitioning in ways that are important for permafrost. Lastly, changes in vegetation and ecosystem distribution will lead to regional and global biophysical and biogeochemical climate feedbacks that may compound or offset local impacts on permafrost soils. Consequently, accurate prediction of the permafrost carbon climate feedback will require detailed understanding of changes in terrestrial ecosystem distribution and function, which depend on the net effects of multiple feedback processes operating across scales in space and time.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.83.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The main objective was to investigate if infrastructure upgrades at the Kitchener MWWTP in 2012 resulted in a recovery of this response in the post‐upgrade period (2013–2016). Two supporting studies showed that the fall season is appropriate for measuring in vitro sex steroid production because it provides stable detection of steroid patterns, and that the sample handling practiced in the present study did not introduce a bias. Infrastructure upgrades of the Kitchener MWWTP resulted in significant reductions in ammonia and estrogenicity. After the upgrades, 11‐ketotestosterone production by MWWTP‐exposed fish increased in 2013 and it continued to recover throughout the study period of 2014 through 2016, returning to levels measured in reference fish. Testosterone production was less sensitive and it lacked consistency. The Waterloo MWWTP underwent some minor upgrades but the level of ammonia and estrogenicity remained variable over time. The production of 11‐ketotestosterone and testosterone in rainbow darter below the Waterloo MWWTP was variable and without a clear recovery pattern over the course of the present study. The results of the present study demonstrated that measuring production of sex steroids (especially 11‐ketotestosterone) over multiple years can be relevant for assessing responses in fish to environmental changes such as those resulting from major infrastructure upgrades.

Here, we present a method for prioritizing strategies for endangered species management based on the likelihood of achieving species’ recovery goals per dollar invested. We demonstrate our approach for 15 species listed under Canada's Species at Risk Act that co‐occur in Southwestern Saskatchewan. Without management, only two species have >50% probability of meeting recovery objectives; whereas, with management, 13 species exceed the >50% threshold with the implementation of just five complementary strategies at a cost of $126m over 20 years. The likelihood of meeting recovery objectives rarely exceeded 70% and two species failed to reach the >50% threshold. Our findings underscore the need to consider the cost, benefit, and feasibility of management strategies when developing recovery plans in order to prioritize implementation in a timely and cost‐effective manner.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.90.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Decoupling the integrated microwave signal originating from soiland vegetation remains a challenge for all microwave remote sensingapplications. To improve satellite and airborne microwave data products inforest environments, a precise and reliable estimation of the relativepermittivity (ε=ε′-iε′′) of trees is required. Wedeveloped an open-ended coaxial probe suitable for in situpermittivity measurements of tree trunks at L-band frequencies (1–2 GHz).The probe is characterized by uncertainty ratios under 3.3 % for a broadrange of relative permittivities (unitless), [2–40] forε′ and [0.1–20] for ε′′. We quantifiedthe complex number describing the permittivity of seven different treespecies in both frozen and thawed states: black spruce, larch, red spruce,balsam fir, red pine, aspen and black cherry. Permittivity variability issubstantial and can range up to 300 % for certain species. Our resultsshow that the permittivity of wood is linked to the freeze–thaw state ofvegetation and that even short winter thaw events can lead to an increase invegetation permittivity. The open-ended coaxial probe proved to be preciseenough to capture the diurnal cycle of water storage inside the trunk for thelength of the growing season.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.92.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

However, the applicability of GRACE data products to more localized studies and their utility to water management authorities have been constrained by their limited spatial resolution (~200,000 km2). Researchers have begun to address these shortcomings with data assimilation approaches that integrate GRACE-derived total water storage estimates into complex regional models, producing higher-resolution estimates of hydrologic variables (~2500 km2). Here we take those approaches one step further by developing an empirically based model capable of downscaling GRACE data to a high-resolution (~16 km2) dataset of groundwater storage changes over a portion of California’s Central Valley. The model utilizes an artificial neural network to generate a series of high-resolution maps of groundwater storage change from 2002 to 2010 using GRACE estimates of variations in total water storage and a series of widely available hydrologic variables (PRISM precipitation and temperature data, digital elevation model (DEM)-derived slope, and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil type). The neural network downscaling model is able to accurately reproduce local groundwater behavior, with acceptable Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values for calibration and validation (ranging from 0.2445 to 0.9577 and 0.0391 to 0.7511, respectively). Ultimately, the model generates maps of local groundwater storage change at a 100-fold higher resolution than GRACE gridded data products without the use of computationally intensive physical models. The model’s simulated maps have the potential for application to local groundwater management initiatives in the region.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.95.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Existing solutions - bookmarks, search, history, and read wear - are valuable but limited in terms of effort, clutter, and interpretability. In this paper, we investigate artificial landmarks as a way to improve support for revisitation in long documents - inspired by visual augmentations seen in physical books such as coloring on page edges or indents cut into pages. We developed several artificial-landmark visualizations that can represent locations even in documents that are many hundreds of pages long, and tested them in studies where participants visited multiple locations in long documents. Results show that providing two columns of landmark icons led to significantly better performance and user preference. Artificial landmarks provide a new mechanism to build spatial memory of long documents - and can be used either alone or with existing techniques like bookmarks, read wear, and search.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.98.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

In large-scale basins, where a variety of climates, topographies, soil types and land uses co-exist to form a highly heterogeneous environment, a more complex nutrient dynamic is imposed by climate and land-use changes. This is the case of the South Saskatchewan River (SSR) that, along with the North Saskatchewan River, forms one of the largest river systems in western Canada. The SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed (SPARROW) model is therefore implemented to assess water quality in the basin, in order to describe spatial and temporal patterns and identify those factors and processes that affect water quality. Forty-five climate and land-use change scenarios comprehended by five General Circulation Models (GCMs) and three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were incorporated into the model to explain how total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) export could vary across the basin in 30, 60 and 90 years from now. According to model results, annual averages of TN and TP export in the SSR are going to increase in the range 0.9–1.28 kg km − 2 year − 1 and 0.12–0.17 kg km − 2 year − 1 , respectively, by the end of the century, due to climate and land-use changes. Higher increases of TP compared to TN are expected since TP and TN are going to increase ∼36% and ∼21%, respectively, by the end of the century. This research will support management plans in order to mitigate nutrient export under future changes of climate and land use.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.99.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Adapting to floods using resilience-based flood risk management (FRM) policies and initiatives is a more appropriate solution than relying solely on flood defence structures or disaster recovery programmes. The primary authority for FRM in Canada is the provinces, but in practice, the policies and responsibilities are distributed across complex, multi-departmental, multi-scalar systems of government. To examine the extent to which institutional arrangements for FRM facilitate or constrain FRM resilience, this paper uses a case study of FRM policies, instruments and practices in the three Canadian prairie provinces where floods have been particularly severe in recent years. Document analysis provided insights into current FRM policies and instruments while semi-structured interviews with 34 individuals working in an FRM capacity informed the roles and responsibilities for FRM implementation. Results indicate that the current FRM policies and instruments across the prairie region have the basic requirements for flood resilience. However, flood resilience is inherently challenged by institutional fragmentation, lack of clarity of FRM roles and responsibilities, and policy layering and competing mandates, which biases FRM towards resistance and recovery solutions. To go beyond solely coordinating flood emergency response and recovery, the paper suggests an overarching regional or national FRM strategy and boundary organisation to coordinate roles and responsibilities for the specific purpose of flood resilience. This requires an agency with the mandate to manage FRM policy instruments, and clearly allocate decision authority amongst the multiple levels and layers of FRM governance.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.100.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

It often becomes challenging for an individual to effectively analyze the large scale scientific data of relatively higher complexity and dimensions, and requires a collaboration of multiple members of different disciplines. Hence, researchers have focused on designing collaborative workflow management systems. However, consistency management in the face of conflicting concurrent operations of the collaborators is a major challenge in such systems. In this paper, we propose a locking scheme (e.g., collaborator gets write access to non-conflicting components of the workflow at a given time) to facilitate consistency management in collaborative scientific workflow management systems. The proposed method allows locking workflow components at a granular level in addition to supporting locks on a targeted part of the collaborative workflow. We conducted several experiments to analyze the performance of the proposed method in comparison to related existing methods. Our studies show that the proposed method can reduce the average waiting time of a collaborator by up to 36.19% in comparison to existing descendent modular level locking techniques for collaborative scientific workflow management systems.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.101.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Since code clones often negatively impact the maintainability of a software system, a great many numbers of code clone detection techniques and tools have been proposed and studied over the last decade. To detect all possible similar source code patterns in general, the clone detection tools work on syntax level (such as texts, tokens, AST and so on) while lacking user-specific preferences. This often means the reported clones must be manually validated prior to any analysis in order to filter out the true positive clones from task or user-specific considerations. This manual clone validation effort is very time-consuming and often error-prone, in particular for large-scale clone detection. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based approach for automating the validation process. In an experiment with clones detected by several clone detectors in several different software systems, we found our approach has an accuracy of up to 87.4% when compared against the manual validation by multiple expert judges. The proposed method shows promising results in several comparative studies with the existing related approaches for automatic code clone validation. We also present our experimental results in terms of different code clone detection tools, machine learning algorithms and open source software systems.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.102.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

In this paper, we fill the gapby proposing a novel modelCroLSimwhich is able to detectsimilar software applications across different programming lan-guages. In our approach, we use the API documentation tofind relationships among the API calls used by the differentprogramming languages. We adopt a deep learning based word-vector learning method to identify semantic relationships amongthe API documentation which we then use to detect cross-language similar software applications. For evaluating CroLSim, we formed a repository consisting of 8,956 Java, 7,658 C#, and 10,232 Python applications collected from GitHub. Weobserved thatCroLSimcan successfully detect similar softwareapplications across different programming languages with a meanaverage precision rate of 0.65, an average confidence rate of3.6 (out of 5) with 75% high rated successful queries, whichoutperforms all related existing approaches with a significantperformance improvement.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.103.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

One statistical difficulty in the research field of Detection and Attribution resides in defining events that can be easily compared and accurately inferred from reasonable sample sizes. As many impacts studies focus on extreme events, the inference of small probabilities and the computation of their associated uncertainties quickly become challenging. In the particular context of event attribution, we address the question of how to compare records between the so-called world as “it might have been been without anthropogenic forcings” and the “world that is”. Records are often the most important events in terms of impact and get much media attention. We will show how to efficiently estimate the ratio of two small probability of records.

However, a detailed analysis of boreal tree hydrodynamics and their interspecific differences is still lacking. Here we examine the hydraulic behaviour of co-occurring larch (Larix laricina) and black spruce (Picea mariana), two characteristic boreal tree species, near the southern limit of the boreal ecozone in central Canada. Sap flux density (Js), concurrently recorded stem radius fluctuations and meteorological conditions are used to quantify tree hydraulic functioning and to scrutinize tree water-use strategies. Our analysis revealed asynchrony in the diel hydrodynamics of the two species with the initial rise in Js occurring 2 h earlier in larch than in black spruce. Interspecific differences in larch and black spruce crown architecture explained the observed asynchrony in their hydraulic functioning. Furthermore, the two species exhibited diverging stomatal regulation strategies with larch and black spruce employing relatively isohydric and anisohydric behaviour, respectively. Such asynchronous and diverging tree-level hydrodynamics provide new insights into the ecosystem-level complementarity in tree form and function, with implications for understanding boreal forests' water and carbon dynamics and their resilience to environmental stress.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.106.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Snowpack accumulation and depletion are important elements of the hydrological cycle in the prairies. The surface runoff generated during snowmelt is transformed into streamflow or fills numerous depressions driving the focused recharge of groundwater in this dry setting. The snowpack in the prairies can undergo several cycles of accumulation and depletion in a winter. The timing of the melt affects the mechanisms of snowpack depletion and their hydrological implications. The effects of midwinter melt were investigated at three sites in the Canadian prairies. Unlike net radiation-driven snowmelt during spring melt, turbulent sensible heat fluxes were the dominant source of energy inputs for midwinter melt occurring in the period with low solar radiation inputs. Midwinter melt events had lower runoff ratios than subsequent spring melt events and had strong impacts on the timing of the focussed recharge. Remote sensing data have shown that midwinter melt events regularly occur under the present climate throughout the Canadian prairies.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.109.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Yet, different data processing to calculate whole-tree water use encapsulates uncertainties that have not been systematically assessed. We quantified uncertainties in conifer sap flux density (Fd ) and stand water use caused by commonly applied methods for deriving zero-flow conditions, dampening and sensor calibration. Their contribution has been assessed using a stem segment calibration experiment and 4 yr of TDM measurements in Picea abies and Larix decidua growing in contrasting environments. Uncertainties were then projected on TDM data from different conifers across the northern hemisphere. Commonly applied methods mostly underestimated absolute Fd . Lacking a site- and species-specific calibrations reduced our stand water-use measurements by 37% and induced uncertainty in northern hemisphere Fd . Additionally, although the interdaily variability was maintained, disregarding dampening and/or applying zero-flow conditions that ignored night-time water use reduced the correlation between environment and Fd . The presented ensemble of calibration curves and proposed dampening correction, together with the systematic quantification of data-processing uncertainties, provide crucial steps in improving whole-tree water-use estimates across spatial and temporal scales.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.110.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

There is little understanding, however, about what techniques and devices are best for carrying out basic operations above, behind, or to the side of the user. We conducted an empirical study comparing two main techniques that are suitable for full-coverage display environments: mouse-based pointing, and ray-cast 'laser' pointing. Participants completed search and pointing tasks on the walls and ceiling, and we measured completion time, path lengths and perceived effort. Our study showed a strong interaction between performance and target location: when the target position was not known a priori the mouse was fastest for targets on the front wall, but ray-casting was faster for targets behind the user. Our findings provide new empirical evidence that can help designers choose pointing techniques for full-coverage spaces.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.111.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

In this study, we analyzed a 5-yr dataset of stormflow events across nine agricultural fields in the lower Great Lakes region of Ontario, Canada, to determine if edge-of-field surface runoff and tile drainage losses (total and dissolved reactive P) were limited by transport mechanisms or P supply. Field sites ranged from clay loam, silt loam, to sandy loam textures. Findings indicate that biogeochemical processes (P supply) were more important for tile drain P loading patterns (i.e., variable flow-weighted mean concentrations ([]) across a range of flow regimes) relative to surface runoff, which trended toward a more chemostatic or transport-limited response. At two sites with the same soil texture, higher tile [] and greater transport limitations were apparent at the site with higher soil available P (STP); however, STP did not significantly correlate with tile [] or P loading patterns across the nine sites. This may reflect that the fields were all within a narrow STP range and were not elevated in STP concentrations (Olsen-P, ≤25 mg kg). For the study sites where STP was maintained at reasonable concentrations, hydrology was less of a driving factor for tile P loadings, and thus management strategies that limit P supply may be an effective way to reduce P losses from fields (e.g., timing of fertilizer application).</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.113.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Country foods (locally harvested fish, game birds, land animals and plants), which contribute to improved food security, can also be a primary route of contaminant exposure among populations in remote regions. A community-based project was launched in the Dehcho and Sahtù regions of the Northwest Territories (Canada) to: 1) assess contaminants exposure and nutrition status; 2) investigate the role of country food on nutrient and contaminant levels and 3) understand the determinants of message perception on this issue. Consultation with community members, leadership, local partners and researchers was essential to refine the design of the project and implement it in a culturally relevant way. This article details the design of a community-based biomonitoring study that investigates country food use, contaminant exposure and nutritional status in Canadian subarctic First Nations in the Dehcho and Sahtù regions. Results will support environmental health policies in the future for these communities. The project was designed to explore the risks and benefits of country foods and to inform the development of public health strategies.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.118.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

High levels of cadmium in the organs of moose from certain regions of the Northwest Territories, Canada, led to the release of consumption notices. These notices recommended that individuals limit their consumption of kidney and liver from moose harvested from the Southern Mackenzie Mountain. A human biomonitoring project was designed to better characterize exposure and risks from contaminants, including cadmium, among Dene/Métis communities of the Northwest Territories Mackenzie Valley, Canada. The project included a dietary assessment (food frequency questionnaire) to estimate moose and caribou organ (kidney and liver) consumption, as well as urine and blood sampling for the measurement of cadmium concentration using mass spectrometry. For a subset of the samples, urine cotinine was also quantified. The results from this biomonitoring research show that cadmium levels in urine (GM = 0.32 μg L-1) and blood (GM = 0.58 μg L-1) are similar to those observed in other populations in Canada. For the 38% of participants reporting eating game organs, current traditional food consumption patterns were not associated with cadmium biomarker levels. Instead, smoking appeared to be the main determinant of cadmium exposure. These results are supporting ongoing efforts at the community and territorial level to identify health priorities and design follow up plans in response to environmental monitoring data.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.119.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

For the Peace‐Athabasca Delta (PAD), floods from the Peace and Athabasca rivers are critical for sustaining abundant shallow water habitat, but their frequency has been in decline for decades over much of its area. Here, we assess current hydrological and limnological status in the PAD by integrating spatial and temporal data. Analysis of water isotope compositions and water chemistry measured at numerous lakes across the delta shows that hydro‐limnological effects of the large‐scale ice‐jam flood event of 2014 failed to persist beyond the early ice‐free season of 2015. Isotope‐inferred paleohydrological records from five hydrologically representative lakes in the PAD indicate that periodic desiccation during the Little Ice Age occurred at the most elevated basin in response to locally arid climatic conditions, yet other lower elevation sites were influenced by high water level on Lake Athabasca owing to increased snowmelt‐ and glacier‐derived river discharge. In contrast, water isotope data during the past 15 yr at all five lakes consistently document the strong role of evaporation, a trend which began in the early to mid‐20th century according to sediment records and is indicative of widespread aridity unprecedented during the past 400 yr. We suggest that integration of hydrological and limnological approaches over space and time is needed to inform assessment of contemporary lake conditions in large, complex floodplain landscapes.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.122.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

As part of their license to operate, mine operators are required to reclaim this altered landscape to a predisturbance capacity. In 2012, Syncrude Canada Limited constructed one of the first of two reclaimed wetlands, the Sandhill Fen Watershed (SFW), to evaluate wetland reclamation strategies. SFW is a 52‐ha system atop soft‐tailings that includes an inflow/outflow pump system, underdrains, upland hummocks, and a fen lowland. In this study, water table dynamics of the fen lowland were evaluated in the 2 years following commissioning (2014–2015) to assess whether this newly constructed watershed has hydrological conditions that facilitate hydric soils with water table regimes similar to reference systems. Results indicate that the location and hydrophysical properties of placed materials control water table responses to both water management and precipitation. This differential water table response in the SFW lowland drove lateral fluxes between adjacent landforms, suggesting periods of intermittent water supply from uplands to wetlands along hummock margins. As in natural systems, the lowland fen exhibited several lateral flow reversals over the 2 years depending upon water level. Water tables on‐average were greater than those observed in natural analogues. Comparison during these first 2 years following commissioning contribute to the increasing insight as to how construction and management practices support reclamation postmining.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.131.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Precipitation events that bring rain and snow to theBanff–Calgary area of Alberta are a critical aspect of the region's watercycle and can lead to major flooding events such as the June 2013 event thatwas the second most costly natural disaster in Canadian history. Because nospecial atmospheric-oriented observations of these events have been made, afield experiment was conducted in March and April 2015 in Kananaskis,Alberta, to begin to fill this gap. The goal was to characterize and betterunderstand the formation of the precipitation at the surface duringspring 2015 at a specific location in the Kananaskis Valley. Within theexperiment, detailed measurements of precipitation and weather conditionswere obtained, a vertically pointing Doppler radar was deployed and weatherballoons were released. Although 17 precipitation events occurred, thisperiod was associated with much less precipitation than normal (−35 %)and above-normal temperatures (2.5 ∘C). Of the 133 h of observedprecipitation, solid precipitation occurred 71 % of the time, mixedprecipitation occurred 9 % and rain occurred 20 %. An analysis of17 504 precipitation particles from 1181 images showed that a wide varietyof crystals and aggregates occurred and approximately 63 % showed signs ofriming. This was largely independent of whether flows aloft were upslope(easterly) or downslope (westerly). In the often sub-saturated surfaceconditions, hydrometeors containing ice occurred at temperatures as high as9 ∘C.

Here, we used a machine learning approach and environmental monitoring data (biological, physical and chemical) to assess the predictability of phytoplankton cell density in one lake across an unprecedented range of time-scales. Communities were highly predictable over hours to months: model R2 decreased from 0.89 at 4 hours to 0.74 at 1 month, and in a long-term dataset lacking fine spatial resolution, from 0.46 at 1 month to 0.32 at 10 years. When cyanobacterial and eukaryotic algal cell densities were examined separately, model-inferred environmental growth dependencies matched laboratory studies, and suggested novel trade-offs governing their competition. High-frequency monitoring and machine learning can set prediction targets for process-based models and help elucidate the mechanisms underlying ecological dynamics.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.133.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Although it is known that seasonal patterns in nutrient availability are key drivers of both stream metabolism and eutrophication, there has been little success in developing a comprehensive understanding of seasonal variations in nutrient export across watersheds or of the relationship between nutrient seasonality and watershed characteristics. In the present study, we have used concentration and discharge data from more than 200 stations across U.S. and Canadian watersheds to identify (1) archetypal seasonal concentration regimes for nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and total phosphorus, and (2) dominant watershed controls on these regimes across a gradient of climate, land use, and topography. Our analysis shows that less impacted watersheds, with more forested and wetland area, most commonly exhibit concentration regimes that are in phase with discharge, with concentration lows occurring during summer low‐flow periods. Agricultural watersheds also commonly exhibit in‐phase behavior, though the seasonality is usually muted compared to that seen in less impacted areas. With increasing urban area, however, nutrient concentrations frequently become essentially aseasonal or even exhibit clearly out‐of‐phase behavior. In addition, our data indicate that seasonal SRP concentration patterns may be strongly influenced by proximal controls such as the presence of dams and reservoirs. In all, these results suggest that human activity is significantly altering nutrient concentration regimes, with large potential consequences for both in‐stream metabolism and eutrophication risk in downstream waterbodies.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.134.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Van Meter et al. report that so much nitrogen from runoff has accumulated in the Mississippi River basin that, even if future agricultural nitrogen inputs are eliminated, it will still take 30 years to realize the 60% decrease in load needed to reduce eutrophication in the Gulf. This legacy effect means that a dramatic shift in land-use practices, which may not be compatible with current levels of agricultural production, will be needed to control hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Science, this issue p. 427 Agricultural nitrogen stored in Mississippi watersheds will slow efforts to reduce hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. In August 2017, the Gulf of Mexico’s hypoxic zone was declared to be the largest ever measured. It has been estimated that a 60% decrease in watershed nitrogen (N) loading may be necessary to adequately reduce eutrophication in the Gulf. However, to date there has been no rigorous assessment of the effect of N legacies on achieving water quality goals. In this study, we show that even if agricultural N use became 100% efficient, it would take decades to meet target N loads due to legacy N within the Mississippi River basin. Our results suggest that both long-term commitment and large-scale changes in agricultural management practices will be necessary to decrease Mississippi N loads and to meet current goals for reducing the size of the Gulf hypoxic zone.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.135.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

In this study, we examined 213 plots in boreal forests dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana) or jack pine (Pinus banksiana) of the Northwest Territories, Canada, after an unprecedentedly large area burned in 2014. Large fire size is associated with high fire intensity and severity, which would manifest as areas with deep burning of the soil organic layer (SOL). Our primary objectives were to estimate burn depth in these fires and then to characterise landscapes vulnerable to deep burning throughout this region. Here we quantify burn depth in black spruce stands using the position of adventitious roots within the soil column, and in jack pine stands using measurements of burned and unburned SOL depths. Using these estimates, we then evaluate how burn depth and the proportion of SOL combusted varies among forest type, ecozone, plot-level moisture and stand density. Our results suggest that most of the SOL was combusted in jack pine stands regardless of plot moisture class, but that black spruce forests experience complete combustion of the SOL only in dry and moderately well-drained landscape positions. The models and calibrations we present in this study should allow future research to more accurately estimate burn depth in Canadian boreal forests.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.137.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Changes to the fire regime are expected to strongly increase combustion emissions of carbon (C) which could alter regional C balance and positively feedback to climate warming. In order to accurately estimate C emissions and thereby better predict future climate feedbacks, there is a need to understand the major sources of heterogeneity that impact C emissions at different scales. Here, we examined 211 field plots in boreal forests dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana) or jack pine (Pinus banksiana) of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada after an unprecedentedly large area burned in 2014. We assessed both aboveground and soil organic layer (SOL) combustion, with the goal of determining the major drivers in total C emissions, as well as to develop a high spatial resolution model to scale emissions in a relatively understudied region of the boreal forest. On average, 3.35 kg C m−2 was combusted and almost 90% of this was from SOL combustion. Our results indicate that black spruce stands located at landscape positions with intermediate drainage contribute the most to C emissions. Indices associated with fire weather and date of burn did not impact emissions, which we attribute to the extreme fire weather over a short period of time. Using these results, we estimated a total of 94.3 Tg C emitted from 2.85 Mha of burned area across the entire 2014 NWT fire complex, which offsets almost 50% of mean annual net ecosystem production in terrestrial ecosystems of Canada. Our study also highlights the need for fine‐scale estimates of burned area that represent small water bodies and regionally specific calibrations of combustion that account for spatial heterogeneity in order to accurately model emissions at the continental scale.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.138.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The Laurentian Great Lakes are the world’s largest supply of freshwater and their ice cover has a major impact on regional weather and climate, ship navigation, and public safety. Ice experts at the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) have been manually producing operational Great Lakes image analysis charts based on visual interpretation of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In that regard, we have investigated the performance of the semi-automated segmentation algorithm “glocal” Iterative Region Growing with Semantics (IRGS) for lake ice classification using dual polarized RADARSAT-2 imagery acquired over Lake Erie. Analysis of various case studies indicated that the “glocal” IRGS algorithm could provide a reliable ice-water classification using dual polarized images with a high overall accuracy of 90.4%. However, lake ice types that are based on stage of development were not effectively identified due to the ambiguous relation between backscatter and ice types. The slight improvement of using dual-pol as opposed to single-pol images for ice-water discrimination was also demonstrated.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.139.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Currently, global estimates of partitioned evaporative and transpiration fluxes remain highly uncertain, especially for high‐latitude ecosystems where measurements are scarce. Forested peat plateaus underlain by permafrost and surrounded by permafrost‐free wetlands characterize approximately 60% (7.0 × 107 km2) of Canadian peatlands. In this study, 22 Picea mariana (black spruce) individuals, the most common tree species of the North American boreal forest, were instrumented with sap flow sensors within the footprint of an eddy covariance tower measuring ET from a forest–wetland mosaic landscape. Sap flux density (JS), together with remote sensing data and in situ measurements of canopy structure, was used to upscale tree‐level JS to overstorey transpiration (TBS). Black spruce trees growing in nutrient‐poor permafrost peat soils were found to have lower mean JS than those growing in mineral soils. Overall, TBS contributed less than 1% to landscape ET. Climate‐change‐induced forest loss and the expansion of wetlands may further minimize the contributions of TBS to ET and increase the contribution of standing water.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.142.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

We inventoried post-fire understory vascular plant communities and tree seedling recruitment in the northwestern Canadian boreal forest and characterized the relative importance of fire effects and fire history, as well as non-fire drivers (i.e., the topoedaphic context and climate), to post-fire vegetation assemblies. Topoedaphic context, pre-fire forest structure and composition, and climate primarily controlled the understory plant communities and shifts in the ranked dominance of tree species (***8% and **13% of variance explained, respectively); however, fire and fire-affected soils were significant secondary drivers of post-fire vegetation. Wildfire had a significant indirect effect on understory vegetation communities through post-fire soil properties (**5%), and fire history and burn severity explained the dominance shifts of tree species (*7%). Fire-related variables were important explanatory variables in classification and regression tree models explaining the dominance shifts of four tree species (R2 = 0.43–0.65). The dominance of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) increased following fires, whereas that of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) declined. The overriding importance of site and climate to post-fire vegetation assemblies may confer some resilience to disturbed forests; however, if projected increases in fire activity in the northwestern boreal forest are borne out, secondary pathways of burn severity, fire frequency, and fire effects on soils are likely to accelerate ongoing climate-driven shifts in species compositions.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.144.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.) peatlands can represent large parts of the expanding wildland–urban interface (WUI) and wildland–industry interface (WII). The boreal plains wildfire regime is predicted to increase in areal extent and intensity, amplifying the need for wildfire management to protect the WUI and WII. Forested peatland ecosystems can burn at high intensity and present challenges for wildfire managers such as severe smouldering combustion and large carbon loss. Fuel management techniques such as mulching treatments (converting surface and canopy fuel to a masticated fuelbed) can be applied to black spruce peatlands, yet the impact on fuel load, condition, and peat burn severity is unclear. Using observations from an experimental fire, we found that a mulch-thinning fuel treatment could reduce peat depth of burn.

However, further understanding of how the existing network instrumentation responds to changes in near surface soil F/T is recommended. This case study describes the results of a small plot-scale (7 × 7 m) study from November 2013 through April 2014 instrumented with 36 impedance probes. Soil temperature and real dielectric permittivity ϵ r 9 were measured every 15 minutes during F/T transition periods at shallow soil depths (0–10 cm). Categorical soil temperature and real dielectric permittivity techniques were used to define the soil F/T state during these periods. Results demonstrate that both methods for detecting soil F/T have strong agreement (84.7–95.6%) during the fall freeze but weak agreement (53.3–60.9%) during the spring thaw. Bootstrapping results demonstrated both techniques showed a mean difference within ±1.0°C and ±1.4 ϵ r 9 between the standard 5 cm below surface measurement depth and probes at 2, 10 and integrated 0–5.7 cm depths installed within the same study plot. Overall this study demonstrates that the Hydra Probe offers promise for near surface soil F/T detection using existing soil moisture monitoring networks particularly for the fall freeze.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.146.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

There is growing interest in utilizing soil moisture networks to meet this validation requirement, although it remains unclear whether the current configuration of these networks is appropriate. To address this issue, a small-scale L-band radiometry study was conducted from November 2014 to April 2015 to capture F/T events. Soil moisture probes measuring soil temperature and real dielectric permittivity were installed within a surface-based L-band radiometer footprint vertically at the surface and horizontally at 2.5, 5 and 10 cm depths. A binary freeze/thaw product was derived using radiometer brightness temperatures and compared to the binary F/T classification using soil temperature, real dielectric permittivity and air temperature measurements. The results of the study found that shallow probe depths (vertical and 2.5 cm) resulted in an improvement in the radiometer F/T product accuracy over the standard 5 cm instrument depth currently utilized at soil moisture networks. Air temperature based approaches for validation result in lower accuracy for F/T events with no snow or wet snow, but performed similarly to soil measurements of temperature and permittivity during dry snow F/T events.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.147.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

Many diverse environmental indicators, including agricultural environmental indicators, are currently in use or being developed. This special collection of technical papers expands on the peer-reviewed literature on environmental indicators and their application to important current issues in the following areas: (i) model-derived indicators to indicate phosphorus losses from arable land to surface runoff and subsurface drainage, (ii) glutathione-ascorbate cycle-related antioxidants as early-warning bioindicators of polybrominated diphenyl ether toxicity in mangroves, and (iii) assessing the effectiveness of using organic matrix biobeds to limit herbicide dissipation from agricultural fields, thereby controlling on-farm point-source pollution. This introductory review also provides an overview of environmental indicators, mainly for agriculture, with examples related to the quality of the agricultural soil-water-air continuum and the application of model-derived indicators. Current knowledge gaps and future lines of investigation are also discussed. It appears that environmental indicators, particularly those for agriculture, work efficiently at the field, catchment, and local scales and serve as valuable metrics of system functioning and response; however, these indicators need to be refined or further developed to comprehensively meet community expectations in terms of providing a consistent picture of relevant issues and/or allowing comparisons to be made nationally or internationally.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.151.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The algorithm is based on retrieving the absorption loss of the snowpack which is directly proportional to the SWE. In the algorithm, Bic-DMRT is first applied to generate a lookup table (LUT) of snowpack backscattering at X- and Ku-band. Regression training is applied to the LUT to transform the dual-frequency backscatter into functions of two parameters: the scattering albedo at X-band and SWE. The background scattering is subtracted from the SnowSAR data to give the volume scattering of snow. Classification of SnowSAR data is applied to provide a priori information. Based on the obtained volume scattering and the priori information, a cost function is established to find SWE. Performance of the retrieval algorithm was tested using three sets of airborne SnowSAR data acquired over mixed areas in Finland and open tundra landscape in Canada. It is shown that the retrieval algorithm has a root-mean-square error below 30 mm of SWE and a correlation coefficient above 0.64.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.153.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

This is particularly true over Canada, where drought is both a frequent and damaging phenomenon with impacts on regional water resources, agriculture, industry, aquatic ecosystems and health. However, nation-wide drought assessments are currently lacking and impacted by limited ground-based observations. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of historical droughts over the whole of Canada, including the role of large-scale teleconnections. Drought events are characterized by the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) over various temporal scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 consecutive months, 6 months from April to September, and 12 months from October to September) applied to different gridded monthly data sets for the period 1950–2013. The Mann Kendall test, Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function, Continuous Wavelet Transform, and Wavelet Coherence analyses are used, respectively, to investigate the trend, spatiotemporal patterns, periodicity, and teleconnectivity of drought events. Results indicate that southern (northern) parts of the country experienced significant trends towards drier (wetter) conditions although substantial variability exists. Two spatially well-defined regions with different temporal evolution of droughts were identified―the Canadian Prairies and Northern-central Canada. The analyses also revealed the presence of a dominant periodicity of between 8–32 months in the Prairie region, and 8–40 months in the Northern central region. These cycles of low-frequency variability are found to be associated principally to the Pacific-North American (PNA) and Multivariate El Nino/Southern Oscillation Index (MEI) relative to other considered large-scale climate indices. This study is the first of its kind to identify dominant periodicities in drought variability over the whole of Canada in terms of when the drought events occur, the duration, and how often they do so.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.154.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The EnMAP payload, the Hyper Spectral Imager (HSI) features an on-board calibration assembly (OBCA) which is designated to provide the optical radiation to monitor the instrument radiometric and spectral ‎stability during the ‎mission lifetime. The assembly comprises two integrating spheres in twin configuration equipped with several different optical radiation sources. The large ‎sphere made of white diffuse reflecting material is dedicated for radiometric stability ‎measurements, while the ‎small sphere, made of rare-earth doped diffuse reflecting material, is dedicated for spectral stability checks. ‎The ‎OBCA utilizes two types of optical radiation sources: ‎tungsten halogen lamps and white light LEDs.Here we report on the spectral and radiometric calibration of the OBCA qualification and flight model in the Reduced Background Calibration Facility 2 (RBCF2) of Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) [1].The demanding requirements were to perform a calibration in air and in vacuum with an uncertainty of less than 2% with a spectral resolution of 0.1 nm over a wavelength range from 400 nm to 2500 nm not exceeding an operating time of 40 h for the halogen lamps and 100 h for the LEDs. Furthermore, a precise mapping of the OBCA exit aperture of size 2 mm by 24 mm with 1 mm sampling diameter had to be performed. For that purposes PTB developed a calibration procedure based on spectral comparisons of the OBCA with respect to dedicated vacuum radiance standards with an FTS in three wavelength ranges which were covered by three beamsplitter detector combinations. A dedicated imaging optics was designed transforming the F:3 opening of the OBCA to the F:8 opening ratio of the FTS and providing also the required small sampling area. Before and after their application, the dedicated vacuum qualified radiance standards were calibrated against the primary standards of PTB and corrected for the transition from air to vacuum and back to account for possible drifts of the sources. By this procedure a spectral and radiometric calibration of the OBCA traceable to the SI was achieved with the aspired uncertainties.[1] C.

This paper describes ESM-SnowMIP, an international coordinated modellingeffort to evaluate current snow schemes, including snow schemes that areincluded in Earth system models, in a wide variety of settings against localand global observations. The project aims to identify crucial processes andcharacteristics that need to be improved in snow models in the context oflocal- and global-scale modelling. A further objective of ESM-SnowMIP is tobetter quantify snow-related feedbacks in the Earth system. Although it isnot part of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project(CMIP6), ESM-SnowMIP is tightly linked to the CMIP6-endorsed Land Surface,Snow and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison (LS3MIP).</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.157.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf

The water table depth–afforestation feedback represents a positive feedback that can enhance peat drying and consolidation and thereby increase peat burn severity; exacerbating the challenges and costs of wildfire suppression efforts and potentially shifting the peatland to a persistent source of atmospheric carbon. To address this wildfire management challenge, we examined burn severity across a gradient of drying in a black spruce dominated peatland that was partially drained in 1975−1980 and burned in the 2016 Fort McMurray Horse River wildfire. We found that post-drainage black spruce annual ring width increased substantially with intense drainage. Average (±SD) basal diameter was 2.6 ± 1.2 cm, 3.2 ± 2.0 cm and 7.9 ± 4.7 cm in undrained (UD), moderately drained (MD) and heavily drained (HD) treatments, respectively. Depth of burn was significantly different between treatments (p &lt; 0.001) and averaged (±SD) 2.5 ± 3.5 cm, 6.4 ± 5.0 cm and 36.9 ± 29.6 cm for the UD, MD and HD treatments, respectively. The high burn severity in the HD treatment included 38% of the treatment that experienced combustion of the entire peat profile, and we estimate that overall 51% of the HD pre-burn peat carbon stock was lost. We argue that the HD treatment surpassed an ecohydrological tipping point to high severity peat burn that may be identified using black spruce stand characteristics in boreal plains bogs. While further studies are needed, we believe that quantifying this threshold will aid in developing effective adaptive management techniques and protecting boreal peatland carbon stocks.</div></div><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/2018.GWF-1.158.pdf data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Open PDF">pdf
