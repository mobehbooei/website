    abstract = "Rural communities dependent on unregulated drinking water are potentially at increased health risk from exposure to contaminants. Perception of drinking water safety influences water consumption, exposure, and health risk. A community‐based participatory approach and probabilistic Bayesian methods were applied to integrate risk perception in a holistic human health risk assessment. Tap water arsenic concentrations and risk perception data were collected from two Saskatchewan communities. Drinking water health standards were exceeded in 67{\%} (51/76) of households in Rural Municipality {\#}184 (RM184) and 56{\%} (25/45) in Beardy's and Okemasis First Nation (BOFN). There was no association between the presence of a health exceedance and risk perception. Households in RM184 or with an annual income {\textgreater}{\$}50,000 were most likely to have in‐house water treatment. The probability of consuming tap water perceived as safe (92{\%}) or not safe (0{\%}) suggested that households in RM184 were unlikely to drink water perceived as not safe. The probability of drinking tap water perceived as safe (77{\%}) or as not safe (11{\%}) suggested households in BOFN contradicted their perception and consumed water perceived as unsafe. Integration of risk perception lowered the adult incremental lifetime cancer risk by 3{\%} to 1.3 {\mbox{$\times$}} 10−5 (95{\%} CI 8.4 {\mbox{$\times$}} 10−8 to 9.0 {\mbox{$\times$}} 10−5) for RM184 and by 8.9 {\mbox{$\times$}} 10−6 (95{\%} CI 2.2 {\mbox{$\times$}} 10−7 to 5.9 {\mbox{$\times$}} 10−5) for BOFN. Probability of exposure to arsenic concentrations {\textgreater}1:100,000, negligible cancer risk, was 23{\%} for RM184 and 22{\%} for BOFN.",
