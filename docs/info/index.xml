These identifiers are used together with the Anthology domain name to form a canonical URL for each of these items, for easy location and reference.
Modern identifier format Everything /ingested/ into the Anthology after 2020 (including volumes from prior years) has been assigned an identifier of the form YEAR.VENUE-VOLUME.NUMBER, where:

We generally distinguish five types, loosely following the ACM Publications Policy:
Corrections to metadata do not require changing the PDF. Examples include correcting the spelling of a name or the title.

(For information about the complete conference management process, particularly for ACL conference publications chairs, please refer to the official documentation.) It is intended for publication chairs of main conferences and standalone events, who have the responsibility of delivering the proceedings for all main conference and workshop volumes to the Anthology director. Chairs of workshops attached to a larger conference should also read this page, but should work through their main conference publication chair instead of directly with the Anthology.</description></item><item><title>Anthology development and API</title><link>https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/info/development/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/info/development/</guid><description>API All Anthology data is stored under the data directory. In the xml directory are the files that contain all the Anthology metadata, in a format described below. The yaml directory contains various other important information.
In addition, we have a Python API that defines objects for papers, authors, volumes, and so on. This is all accessible by an Anthology object that can be access in the following manner. First, clone the Anthology Github repo and setup your environment:</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/info/credits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mobehbooei.github.io/website/info/credits/</guid><description>The ACL Anthology is largely a volunteer-run organization.
