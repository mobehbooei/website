    abstract = "Abstract. Water resources in cold regions in western Canada face severe risksposed by anthropogenic global warming as evapotranspiration increasesand precipitation regimes shift. Although understanding the watercycle is key for addressing climate change issues, it is difficult toobtain high spatial- and temporal-resolution observations ofhydroclimatic processes, especially in remote regions. Climate modelsare useful tools for dissecting and diagnosing these processes,especially the convection-permitting (CP) high-resolution regionalclimate simulation, which provides advantages over lower-resolution models by explicitly representing convection. In addition to better representingconvective systems, higher spatial resolution also better representstopography, mountain meteorology, and highly heterogeneousgeophysical features. However, there is little work withconvection-permitting regional climate models conducted over westernCanada. Focusing on the Mackenzie River and Saskatchewan River basins, thisstudy investigated the surface water budget and atmospheric moisturebalance in historical and representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) projections using 4 km CP WeatherResearch and Forecasting (WRF). We compared the high-resolution 4 km CPWRF and three common reanalysis datasets, namely the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), andEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecastsreanalysis interim dataset (ERA-Interim). High-resolution WRF outperforms the reanalyses inbalancing the surface water budget in both river basins with muchlower residual terms. For the pseudo-global-warming scenario at theend of the 21st century with representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) radiative forcing, both theMackenzie River and Saskatchewan River basins show increases in theamplitude for precipitation and evapotranspiration and a decrease inrunoff. The Saskatchewan River basin (SRB) shows a moderate increase inprecipitation in the west and a small decrease in the east. Combinedwith a significant increase in evapotranspiration in a warmer climate,the Saskatchewan River basin would have a larger deficit of waterresources than in the current climate based on the pseudo-global-warming (PGW) simulation. Thehigh-resolution simulation also shows that the difference of atmosphericwater vapour balance in the two river basins is due to floworientation and topography differences at the western boundaries ofthe two basins. The sensitivity of water vapour balance to fine-scaletopography and atmospheric processes shown in this study demonstratesthat high-resolution dynamical downscaling is important forlarge-scale water balance and hydrological cycles.",
