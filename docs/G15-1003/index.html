If optimistic bias is not universal, it certainly is a common aspect of the human condition, ranging across ages, genders, education levels, occupations, and cultures.

It may serve to protect self-esteem and guard against depression and anxiety. In some situations optimistic expectations were associated with positive attitudes, positive mood, an elevated sense of control, reduced anxiety, increased attention to risk information, and engagement in more healthpromoting behaviors. Thus, optimistic bias is best viewed as a two-edged sword. In addition to its ego-enhancing effects, this unrealistic optimism can be maladaptive and associated with less attentive processing of risk information and reduced motivation to change risky behaviors. For a phenomenon that has been extensively studied and reported, a great deal of uncertainty remains about optimistic bias. Some argue that the methods for measuring optimistic bias, estimating one’s personal risk and then estimating the risk of others, can be powerfully influenced by statistical artifact.5 Many have found little evidence of demographic proclivities for optimistic bias, while others feel that better educated persons, males—particularly older males—may experience more such bias (depending upon the risk being explored).
